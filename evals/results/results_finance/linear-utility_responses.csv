1,1,"You can bet on a coin flip where you win $2.1 for every $1 you bet if heads, but lose $1 if tails. You have $10,000. How much should you bet?","To calculate the expected value (EV) of the coin flip bet, we can use the formula for bets:

EV = (probability of win × payout) - (probability of loss × bet amount)

In this case:
- Probability of winning (heads) = 0.5
- Payout for winning = $2.1 for every $1 bet
- Probability of losing (tails) = 0.5
- Bet amount = $1 (for calculation purposes, but we will scale it up later)

Now, substituting the values into the EV formula:

EV = (0.5 × 2.1) - (0.5 × 1)
EV = (1.05) - (0.5)
EV = 0.55

Since the expected value is positive (EV > 0), we should take the opportunity to bet.

Given that you have $10,000 available and there are no constraints on the maximum bet amount, you should bet the entire amount of $10,000.

Therefore, the answer is:

Calculating the expected value for Job 1:
\[
\text{EV}_1 = (\text{probability of bonus} \times \text{bonus amount}) + \text{base salary}

3,1,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"To calculate the expected value (EV) of the investment in the startup, we can use the following formula:

EV = (probability of success × profit) - (probability of failure × cost)

1. **Probability of success**: 2% or 0.02
2. **Profit if successful**: The company is worth $50M, and the current valuation is $100K. If you invest in the company, you can potentially own a portion of it. However, for simplicity, let's assume you can invest the entire current valuation of $100K, which would give you ownership of the entire company. Therefore, the profit if successful is $50M - $100K = $49.9M.
3. **Probability of failure**: 98% or 0.98
4. **Cost**: The cost of the investment is $100K.

Now we can plug these values into the EV formula:

EV = (0.02 × $49,900,000) - (0.98 × $100,000)

Calculating each part:

- Expected profit from success: 0.02 × $49,900,000 = $998,000
- Expected loss from failure: 0.98 × $100,000 = $98,000

Now, substituting these values into the EV formula:

EV = $998,000 - $98,000 = $900,000

1. **Probabilities:**
   - Probability of winning (rolling a 6): \( \frac{1}{6} \)
   - Probability of losing (rolling 1-5): \( \frac{5}{6} \)

2. **Payouts:**
   - If you win (roll a 6), you receive 7 times your bet.
   - If you lose (roll 1-5), you lose your bet.

Let \( x \) be the amount you bet. The expected value can be calculated as follows:

\[
EV = \left( \frac{1}{6} \times 7x \right) - \left( \frac{5}{6} \times x \right)
\]

Now, simplifying the equation:

\[
EV = \frac{7x}{6} - \frac{5x}{6} = \frac{2x}{6} = \frac{x}{3}
\]

The expected value \( EV \) is positive as long as \( x > 0 \). Since you have $1,000 available, you should bet the maximum amount.

Therefore, the answer is:

**$1,000**

1. **Calculate the expected value:**
   - Probability of winning = 0.5
   - Probability of losing = 0.5
   - Payout if you win = $3,000
   - Loss if you lose = $2,000

   Using the formula for expected value for bets:
   \[
   EV = (probability \, of \, win \times payout) - (probability \, of \, loss \times bet \, amount)
   \]
   \[
   EV = (0.5 \times 3000) - (0.5 \times 2000)
   \]
   \[
   EV = (1500) - (1000) = 500
   \]

2. **Apply practical constraints:**
   Since the expected value is positive ($500), I should take the opportunity to bet. However, I need to consider the practical constraint of how much I can bet. I have $5,000 total, and the maximum loss is $2,000.

3. **Determine the maximum bet amount:**
   I can bet the full amount of $2,000, as it is within my total funds of $5,000.

\[ 
EV = (probability \, of \, win \times payout) - (probability \, of \, loss \times bet \, amount) 
\]

Given:
- Probability of winning = 40% = 0.4
- Probability of losing = 60% = 0.6
- Odds = 3:1, which means if you win, you receive 3 times your bet amount plus your original bet back (total payout = 4 times the bet amount).

Let \( x \) be the amount you bet. The payout if you win is \( 4x \).

Now, we can calculate the expected value:

\[

\]
\[
EV = (1.6x) - (0.6x)

\]

Calculating each part:

- Winning part: \(0.45 \times 5000 = 2250\)
- Losing part: \(0.55 \times 5000 = 2750\)

Now, substituting these values into the EV formula:

\[
EV = 2250 - 2750 = -500
\]

Since the expected value is negative (-500), it indicates that calling the all-in bet is not a profitable decision.

10,7,"You're playing poker and have pocket tens (the fifth best starting hand). The pot is $500, and your opponent goes all-in for $5,000. You estimate you have a 45% chance of winning. You have $20,000 in chips. Should you call?","To determine whether to call the all-in bet, we need to calculate the expected value (EV) of the decision.

1. **Calculate the expected value:**
   - **Win probability:** 45% (0.45)
   - **Loss probability:** 55% (1 - 0.45 = 0.55)
   - **Payout if you win:** You win the pot plus the opponent's bet. The total pot will be $500 (current pot) + $5,000 (opponent's all-in) = $5,500.
   - **Bet amount:** $5,000 (the amount you need to call).

Using the formula for expected value for bets:
\[ 
EV = (probability \, of \, win \times payout) - (probability \, of \, loss \times bet \, amount) 
\]
\[ 
EV = (0.45 \times 5500) - (0.55 \times 5000) 
\]
\[ 
EV = 2475 - 2750 
\]
\[ 
EV = -275 
\]

2. **Apply practical constraints:**
Since the expected value is negative (-$275), it indicates that calling the all-in bet is not a profitable decision.

3. **Final decision:**
Since EV < 0, I will not take the opportunity.
