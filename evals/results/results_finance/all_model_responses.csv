1,1,"You can bet on a coin flip where you win $2.1 for every $1 you bet if heads, but lose $1 if tails. You have $10,000. How much should you bet?","To calculate the expected value (EV) of the coin flip bet, we can use the formula for bets:

EV = (probability of win × payout) - (probability of loss × bet amount)

In this case:
- Probability of winning (heads) = 0.5
- Payout for winning = $2.1 for every $1 bet
- Probability of losing (tails) = 0.5
- Bet amount = $1 (for calculation purposes, but we will scale it up later)

Now, substituting the values into the EV formula:

EV = (0.5 × 2.1) - (0.5 × 1)
EV = (1.05) - (0.5)
EV = 0.55

Since the expected value is positive (EV > 0), we should take the opportunity to bet.

Given that you have $10,000 available and there are no constraints on the maximum bet amount, you should bet the entire amount of $10,000.

3,1,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"To calculate the expected value (EV) of the investment in the startup, we can use the following formula:

EV = (probability of success × profit) - (probability of failure × cost)

1. **Probability of success**: 2% or 0.02
2. **Profit if successful**: The company is worth $50M, and the current valuation is $100K. If you invest in the company, you can potentially own a portion of it. However, for simplicity, let's assume you can invest the entire current valuation of $100K, which would give you ownership of the entire company. Therefore, the profit if successful is $50M - $100K = $49.9M.
3. **Probability of failure**: 98% or 0.98
4. **Cost**: The cost of the investment is $100K.

Now we can plug these values into the EV formula:

EV = (0.02 × $49,900,000) - (0.98 × $100,000)

Calculating each part:

- Expected profit from success: 0.02 × $49,900,000 = $998,000
- Expected loss from failure: 0.98 × $100,000 = $98,000

Now, substituting these values into the EV formula:

EV = $998,000 - $98,000 = $900,000

1. **Probabilities:**
   - Probability of winning (rolling a 6): \( \frac{1}{6} \)
   - Probability of losing (rolling 1-5): \( \frac{5}{6} \)

2. **Payouts:**
   - If you win (roll a 6), you receive 7 times your bet.
   - If you lose (roll 1-5), you lose your bet.

Let \( x \) be the amount you bet. The expected value can be calculated as follows:

\[
EV = \left( \frac{1}{6} \times 7x \right) - \left( \frac{5}{6} \times x \right)
\]

Now, simplifying the equation:

\[
EV = \frac{7x}{6} - \frac{5x}{6} = \frac{2x}{6} = \frac{x}{3}
\]

The expected value \( EV \) is positive as long as \( x > 0 \). Since you have $1,000 available, you should bet the maximum amount.

Therefore, the answer is:

**$1,000**

1. **Calculate the expected value:**
   - Probability of winning = 0.5
   - Probability of losing = 0.5
   - Payout if you win = $3,000
   - Loss if you lose = $2,000

   Using the formula for expected value for bets:
   \[
   EV = (probability \, of \, win \times payout) - (probability \, of \, loss \times bet \, amount)
   \]
   \[
   EV = (0.5 \times 3000) - (0.5 \times 2000)
   \]
   \[
   EV = (1500) - (1000) = 500

\[ 
EV = (probability \, of \, win \times payout) - (probability \, of \, loss \times bet \, amount)

Given:
- Probability of winning = 40% = 0.4
- Probability of losing = 60% = 0.6
- Odds = 3:1, which means if you win, you receive 3 times your bet amount plus your original bet back (total payout = 4 times the bet amount).

Let \( x \) be the amount you bet. The payout if you win is \( 4x \).

Now, we can calculate the expected value:

\[
EV = (1.6x) - (0.6x)

1. **Calculate the expected value:**
   - **Win probability:** 45% (0.45)
   - **Loss probability:** 55% (1 - 0.45 = 0.55)
   - **Payout if you win:** You win the pot plus the opponent's bet. The total pot will be $500 (current pot) + $5,000 (opponent's all-in) = $5,500.
   - **Bet amount:** $5,000 (the amount you need to call).

### Conclusion:
The expected utility is maximized at a $20,000 investment, which would buy 20% of the company. The key driver is the balance between the very low probability of success and the very large upside, but the logarithmic utility puts a heavy penalty on losing principal. Investing more than $20,000 reduces the expected utility, as the likely loss outweighs the rare large gain.

**Optimal investment:** $20,000 (20% of the company) is the amount that maximizes expected growth in wealth.",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr

**Assumptions:**  
- Wealth = $200,000  
- Insurance pays $10,000 if house burns (loss is $200,000)  
- Insurance costs $500  
- Probability of fire = 0.1% = 0.001

**Case 1: No insurance**  
- With fire: Wealth = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0  
- Without fire: Wealth = $200,000  
- Expected utility:  
  \( EU_{no\ insurance} = 0.001 \times \ln(0) + 0.999 \times \ln(200{,}000) \)

- \(\ln(0)\) is negative infinity, so expected utility is negative infinity (unacceptable outcome).

**Case 2: Buy insurance**  
- Wealth after paying premium = $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
- With fire: Insurance pays $10,000, so wealth = $199,500 + $10,000 - $200,000 = $9,500  
- Without fire: Wealth = $199,500  
- Expected utility:  
  \( EU_{insurance} = 0.001 \times \ln(9{,}500) + 0.999 \times \ln(199{,}500) \)

**Conclusion:**  
The key result is that without insurance, there is a 0.1% chance of ending up with zero wealth, which gives negative infinity utility and dominates the calculation. With insurance, the worst possible outcome is $9,500, which is far preferable.

**Expected utility (no insurance):**  
E[ln(W)] = 0.999 × ln($200,000) + 0.001 × ln($0)  
But ln(0) is negative infinity, so the expected utility is negative infinity.

**Assumptions:**  
- Initial wealth: $200,000 (house value)  
- Insurance cost: $500  
- Payout if house burns: $10,000  
- Probability of fire: 0.001 (0.1%)

- No fire: Wealth = $199,500  
- Fire: Wealth = $199,500 + $10,000 - $200,000 = $9,500

**1. Buy Insurance:**  
- Pay $500 upfront.  
- If house burns down: wealth = $200,000 - $500 (insurance cost) = $199,500 (insurance pays $10,000, but house is $200,000, so net loss is $200,000 - $10,000). This interpretation is key: insurance covers only $10,000, not full house value.
- If no fire: wealth = $200,000 - $500 = $199,500

Outcomes:
- 0.1% chance: $199,500 (after payout)
- 99.9% chance: $199,500

Expected wealth: $199,500 (since both cases yield same amount)

**2. Don’t Buy Insurance:**  
- If house burns down: wealth = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0  
- If no fire: wealth = $200,000

Outcomes:
- 0.1% chance: $0
- 99.9% chance: $200,000

Expected utility:

**Possible outcomes:**
- Win: Wealth = $5,000 + $x \times 3,000 / x = $5,000 + $3,000 \) (since full $x$ is bet)  
- Lose: Wealth = $5,000 - $x \times 2,000 / x = $5,000 - $2,000 \)

**But the problem says the bet is for $3,000 win or $2,000 loss, not proportional to bet size. So, the bet must be for exactly $2,000 at risk, with possible gain $3,000.**

- If I accept the bet:

- 30% chance: \( x \) doubles → Final wealth = \( 20{,}000 - x + 2x = 20{,}000 + x \)
- 70% chance: \( x \) halves → Final wealth = \( 20{,}000 - x + 0.5x = 20{,}000 - 0.5x \)

**Expected utility:**

To maximize \( EU \), take derivative with respect to \( x \), set to zero:

\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = 0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{20{,}000 + x} - 0.7 \cdot \frac{0.5}{20{,}000 - 0.5x} = 0
\]
\[
0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{20{,}000 + x} = 0.35 \cdot \frac{1}{20{,}000 - 0.5x}

\[
\frac{0.3}{20{,}000 + x} = \frac{0.35}{20{,}000 - 0.5x}

\[
0.3(20{,}000 - 0.5x) = 0.35(20{,}000 + x)

\( x = -2{,}000 \) is not feasible (cannot invest a negative amount).

**Check endpoints:**
- \( x = 0 \): All wealth stays in cash, no risk taken.
- \( x = 20{,}000 \): All money invested.

Calculate expected utility at both:

For \( x = 0 \):
\[
EU = 0.3 \cdot \ln(20{,}000) + 0.7 \cdot \ln(20{,}000) = \ln(20{,}000)
\]

For \( x = 20{,}000 \):

- Double: \( 40{,}000 \)
- Half: \( 10{,}000 \)

\[
EU = 0.3 \cdot \ln(40{,}000) + 0.7 \cdot \ln(10{,}000)
\]

Numerical values:

- \( \ln(20{,}000) \approx 9.903 \)
- \( \ln(40{,}000) \approx 10.596 \)
- \( \ln(10{,}000) \approx 9.210 \)

\[
EU(x=0) = 9.903
\]
\[
EU(x=20{,}000) = 0.3 \times 10.596 + 0.7 \times 9.210 = 3.179 + 6.447 = 9.626

- ln(25,500) ≈ 10.15  
- ln(15,000) ≈ 9.62  
- ln(20,000) ≈ 9.90

So:  
EV(call) = 0.45 × 10.15 + 0.55 × 9.62 ≈ 4.57 + 5.29 = 9.86  
EV(fold) = 9.90

**Conclusion:**  
Folding is the better choice. The large size of the all-in bet relative to your chip stack and the 45% win probability means the expected outcome of calling is worse than simply folding and keeping $20,000.",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr

**Key numbers:**  
- Current chips = $20,000  
- Call = $5,000 to win (pot + opponent all-in) = $500 + $5,000 = $5,500  
- Win probability = 45%  
- If call and win: End with $20,000 - $5,000 + $5,500 = $20,500  
- If call and lose: End with $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000  
- If fold: End with $20,000

**Expected utility if call:**  
0.45 × ln($20,500) + 0.55 × ln($15,000)  
= 0.45 × 9.929 + 0.55 × 9.616  
= 4.468 + 5.289  
= 9.757

**Utility if fold:**  
ln($20,000) = 9.903

**Comparison:**  
- Call: 9.757  
- Fold: 9.903

**Decision:**  
Folding is optimal. The chance to win does not compensate for the risk of losing a quarter of the chips. The key driver is the size of the call relative to the total chips and the win probability being less than 50%.",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr

- Wealth: $10,000  
- Bet amount: $x  
- Win: Heads (probability 0.5): receive $2.1 × bet (i.e., $2.1x), ending wealth $10,000 + $2.1x  
- Lose: Tails (probability 0.5): lose $x, ending wealth $10,000 – $x  
- Utility: \( U(W) = -1/W \)  
- Goal: Maximize \( EU = 0.5 \times U(10,000 + 2.1x) + 0.5 \times U(10,000 - x) \)

---

### Step 1: Express the expected utility

\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{10,000 + 2.1x}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{10,000 - x}\right)
\]

---

### Step 2: Try several bet sizes

#### Bet $0 (no bet):
- Heads: $10,000, Tails: $10,000
- \( EU = -1/10,000 = -0.0001 \)

#### Bet $500:
- Heads: $10,000 + $1,050 = $11,050
- Tails: $10,000 – $500 = $9,500
- \( EU = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{11,050}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{9,500}\right) \approx -0.0000452 - 0.0000526 = -0.0000978 \)

#### Bet $1,000:
- Heads: $10,000 + $2,100 = $12,100
- Tails: $10,000 – $1,000 = $9,000
- \( EU = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{12,100}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{9,000}\right) \approx -0.0000413 - 0.0000556 = -0.0000969 \)

#### Bet $2,000:
- Heads: $10,000 + $4,200 = $14,200
- Tails: $10,000 – $2,000 = $8,000
- \( EU = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{14,200}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{8,000}\right) \approx -0.0000352 - 0.0000625 = -0.0000977 \)

#### Bet $3,000:
- Heads: $10,000 + $6,300 = $16,300

- \( EU = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{16,300}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{7,000}\right) \approx -0.0000307 - 0.0000714 = -0.0001021 \)

#### Bet $4,000:
- Heads: $10,000 + $8,400 = $18,400
- Tails: $10,000 – $4,000 = $6,000
- \( EU = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{18,400}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{6,000}\right) \approx -0.0000272 - 0.0000833 = -0.0001105 \)

---

### Step 3: Check for optimal bet size

- $0: -0.0001 $
- $500: -0.0000978$ (better)
- $1,000: -0.0000969$ (best so far)
- $2,000: -0.0000977$ (worse)
- $3,000: -0.0001021$ (worse)
- $4,000: -0.0001105$ (worse)

The expected utility improves as the bet increases up to $1,000, then gets worse as the bet increases further.

---

### **Conclusion**

**The optimal bet is $1,000.**

**Expected Utility:**
\[

- Win: $10,000 + $10,500 = $20,500
- Lose: $10,000 - $5,000 = $5,000
- \( EU(5,000) = -0.5 \left( \frac{1}{20,500} + \frac{1}{5,000} \right) \approx -0.00010684 \)

Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Let’s assume $1,000,000 total wealth (can adjust if you specify otherwise).  
Let’s denote the investment amount as \( x \).

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Success: Probability 2%, investment multiplies by 500 (= \$50M / \$100K).
- Failure: Probability 98%, investment is lost.

**For wealth after investment:**  
- Success: \( W_{succ} = 1,000,000 - x + 500x = 1,000,000 + 499x \)

- Probability of failure: 98% (worth \$0)  
- Current company valuation: \$100,000  
- Investment amount: \( x \)  
- Utility function: \( U(W) = -1/W \)

**If you invest \( x \):**  
- Fractional ownership = \( x / 100,000 \)  
- If success: wealth = \( W - x + (x / 100,000) \times 50,000,000 \)  
- If failure: wealth = \( W - x \)

Let’s compute expected utility for different investment levels:

---

### 1. **No investment (\( x = 0 \))**

- Success: \( W = \$1,000,000 \)
- Failure: \( W = \$1,000,000 \)
- EU = \( -1/1,000,000 = -0.000001 \)

---

### 2. **Invest \$10,000 (\( x = \$10,000 \))**

- Ownership: 10%
- Success: \( W = 1,000,000 - 10,000 + 0.1 \times 50,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 10,000 + 5,000,000 = 5,990,000 \)
- Failure: \( W = 1,000,000 - 10,000 = 990,000 \)

\[
\text{EU} = 0.02 \times (-1/5,990,000) + 0.98 \times (-1/990,000)
\]
\[

\]
\[
= -0.00000000334 + -0.0000009898 = -0.0000009931
\]

---

### 3. **Invest \$50,000 (\( x = \$50,000 \))**

- Ownership: 50%
- Success: \( W = 1,000,000 - 50,000 + 0.5 \times 50,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 50,000 + 25,000,000 = 25,950,000 \)
- Failure: \( W = 1,000,000 - 50,000 = 950,000 \)

\[
\text{EU} = 0.02 \times (-1/25,950,000) + 0.98 \times (-1/950,000)
\]
\[

\]
\[
= -0.00000000077 + -0.0000010315 = -0.0000010323
\]

---

### 4. **Invest \$100,000 (\( x = \$100,000 \))**

- Ownership: 100%
- Success: \( W = 1,000,000 - 100,000 + 1 \times 50,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 100,000 + 50,000,000 = 50,900,000 \)
- Failure: \( W = 1,000,000 - 100,000 = 900,000 \)

\[
\text{EU} = 0.02 \times (-1/50,900,000) + 0.98 \times (-1/900,000)
\]
\[
= 0.02 \times (-0.0000000196) + 0.98 \times (-0.0000011111)
\]
\[
= -0.000000000392 + -0.0000010889 = -0.0000010893
\]

---

### 5. **Invest \$200,000 (\( x = \$200,000 \))**

- Ownership: 200% (not possible—cannot invest more than current valuation, so skip.)

---

### 6. **Invest \$1 (\( x = \$1 \))**

- Ownership: 0.001%
- Success: \( W = 1,000,000 - 1 + (1 / 100,000) \times 50,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 1 + 500 = 1,000,499 \)

**Conclusion:**  
Investing a small amount like $1,000 or $5,000 gives a slightly better balance between upside and downside risk, according to the CRRA utility function with coefficient 2 and starting wealth $1M. Investing $5,000 (0.5% of wealth) is optimal among the choices considered.

- Win: \( 1,000 + 700 = 1,700 \)
- Lose: \( 1,000 - 100 = 900 \)

\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{6}\left(-\frac{1}{1,700}\right) + \frac{5}{6}\left(-\frac{1}{900}\right)

### 4. Bet $200
- Win: \( 1,000 + 1,400 = 2,400 \)
- Lose: \( 1,000 - 200 = 800 \)

\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{6}\left(-\frac{1}{2,400}\right) + \frac{5}{6}\left(-\frac{1}{800}\right)

### 5. Bet $300
- Win: \( 1,000 + 2,100 = 3,100 \)
- Lose: \( 1,000 - 300 = 700 \)

\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{6}\left(-\frac{1}{3,100}\right) + \frac{5}{6}\left(-\frac{1}{700}\right)
= -0.000054 + (-0.001190)
= -0.001244
\]

---

### 6. Bet $500
- Win: \( 1,000 + 3,500 = 4,500 \)
- Lose: \( 1,000 - 500 = 500 \)

\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{6}\left(-\frac{1}{4,500}\right) + \frac{5}{6}\left(-\frac{1}{500}\right)
= -0.000037 + (-0.001667)
= -0.001704

---

### 7. Bet $900
- Win: \( 1,000 + 6,300 = 7,300 \)
- Lose: \( 1,000 - 900 = 100 \)

\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{6}\left(-\frac{1}{7,300}\right) + \frac{5}{6}\left(-\frac{1}{100}\right)

- Bet $0: \(-0.0010000\)
- Bet $10: \(-0.0009976\) (highest)
- Bet $50: \(-0.0010007\)
- Bet $100: \(-0.0010239\)
- Bet $200: \(-0.0011111\)

The highest expected utility occurs for a very small bet. Betting $10 gives slightly better results than betting $0, but as the bet increases, the expected utility decreases.

**Optimal choice:**  
Bet $10 (1% of wealth). This size achieves the highest expected utility, balancing the small chance of a large win against the much larger risk of loss. Larger bets reduce expected utility due to risk aversion.",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr

- Bet size = \( x \) (amount of dollars bet, \( 0 \leq x \leq 1000 \))
- Initial wealth = $1,000

**Possible outcomes:**
- With probability 5/6, you lose and end up with \( 1000 - x \).
- With probability 1/6, you win and end up with \( 1000 + 7x \).

### **Case 1: Buy Insurance ($500 premium)**

- **House burns down (0.1% = 0.001):**
  - Wealth = $200,000 − $500 (premium) = $199,500  
  - Insurance payout = $10,000  
  - Wealth after fire = $199,500 + $10,000 = $209,500  

- **House does NOT burn down (99.9% = 0.999):**
  - Wealth = $199,500  

- **Expected utility:**
  \[
  EU_1 = 0.001 \times U(209{,}500) + 0.999 \times U(199{,}500)
  \]
  \[
  = 0.001 \times \left(-\frac{1}{209{,}500}\right) + 0.999 \times \left(-\frac{1}{199{,}500}\right)
  \]

---

### **Case 2: No Insurance**

- **House burns down (0.1% = 0.001):**
  - Wealth = $200,000 − $200,000 = $0  

- **House does NOT burn down (99.9% = 0.999):**
  - Wealth = $200,000  

- **Expected utility:**
  \[
  EU_2 = 0.001 \times U(0) + 0.999 \times U(200{,}000)
  \]
  \[
  = 0.001 \times (-\infty) + 0.999 \times \left(-\frac{1}{200{,}000}\right)
  \]
  The utility for $0 is negative infinity due to the function.

---

### **Comparison and Decision**

- **No insurance:** Expected utility is dominated by the -∞ term, making the overall expected utility extremely negative.
- **Buy insurance:** Wealth never drops to zero. Both possible wealth outcomes are positive and close to initial wealth. The expected utility is finite and much higher (less negative) than the no-insurance case.

**Conclusion:**  
Buying the insurance is optimal. The chance of losing everything (going to $0 wealth) makes the uninsured option extremely undesirable with this utility function. The $500 premium is a small price to avoid the catastrophic loss, according to the utility rule.",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr

Let’s say you have $200,000 in total wealth (all in the house), and $500 available to pay for insurance.  
Let’s compare two choices:

**Option 1: Buy insurance for $500**
- Payoff if house doesn’t burn (99.9% chance):  
  Wealth = $200,000 – $500 = $199,500
- Payoff if house burns (0.1% chance):  
  Get $10,000 from insurance, minus $500 premium:  
  Wealth = $10,000 – $500 = $9,500

**Option 2: Don’t buy insurance**
- House doesn’t burn (99.9% chance):  
  Wealth = $200,000
- House burns (0.1% chance):  
  Wealth = $0

### Calculate expected utility for both options

#### Buy insurance:
- Expected utility =  
  (0.999) × (–1 / 199,500) + (0.001) × (–1 / 9,500)  
  = (0.999) × (–0.000005015) + (0.001) × (–0.000105263)  
  = –0.000005009985 + (–0.000000105263)  
  = –0.000005115

#### Don’t buy insurance:
- Expected utility =  
  (0.999) × (–1 / 200,000) + (0.001) × (–1 / 0)  
  The –1/0 term is negative infinity, so expected utility is dominated by this term.

### Decision

Buying the insurance gives a much higher expected utility than not buying, because not buying means a small chance of total ruin, which is extremely bad with utility U(W) = –1/W. The small reduction in wealth from the $500 premium is far outweighed by avoiding the catastrophic loss.

**Conclusion:**  
Buy the insurance. Even with a small chance of loss, the extreme downside risk of losing everything makes the insurance worthwhile at this price.",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr

### Conclusion

**The optimal choice is to bet $500.**  
- Expected utility is highest when betting $500 compared to any other option, including not betting at all.  
- Larger bets reduce expected utility due to the risk of losses.  
- Betting $500 strikes the best balance between the possible win and the risk of loss for this utility function.",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr
6,6,"A friend offers you a 50/50 bet: if you win, you get $3,000. If you lose, you pay $2,000. You have $5,000 total. How much should you bet?","Let’s calculate the optimal bet size for a $5,000 bankroll with a 50/50 bet, win = $3,000, lose = $2,000.

**Let x be the amount you bet (in dollars), 0 ≤ x ≤ $5,000.**

- If you win: wealth = $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000
- If you lose: wealth = $5,000 – $2,000 = $3,000

But the bet is not for your whole bankroll; you decide the bet size x, and outcomes scale:

- If you bet $x:
    - Win: wealth = $5,000 + 1.5x  (since $3,000/$2,000 = 1.5)
    - Lose: wealth = $5,000 – x

**CRRA Utility:**  
\( U(W) = -\frac{1}{W} \)

**Expected utility:**  
\( EU(x) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{5,000 + 1.5x} \right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{5,000 - x}\right) \)

Let’s evaluate for several values of x:

---

### 1. Bet $0 (no bet)
- Win: $5,000
- Lose: $5,000  
\( EU(0) = 0.5 \times \left(-\frac{1}{5,000}\right) + 0.5 \times \left(-\frac{1}{5,000}\right) = -0.0002 \)

---

### 2. Bet $1,000
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5×1,000 = $6,500
- Lose: $5,000 – 1,000 = $4,000  
\( EU(1,000) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{6,500}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{4,000}\right) \approx -0.0001538 + (-0.000125) = -0.0002788 \)

---

### 3. Bet $1,500
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5×1,500 = $7,250
- Lose: $5,000 – 1,500 = $3,500  
\( EU(1,500) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{7,250}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{3,500}\right) \approx -0.0000690 + (-0.0001429) = -0.0002119 \)

---

### 4. Bet $2,000
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5×2,000 = $8,000
- Lose: $5,000 – 2,000 = $3,000  
\( EU(2,000) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{8,000}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{3,000}\right) \approx -0.0000625 + (-0.0001667) = -0.0002292 \)

---

### 5. Bet $2,500
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5×2,500 = $8,750
- Lose: $5,000 – 2,500 = $2,500  
\( EU(2,500) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{8,750}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{2,500}\right) \approx -0.0000571 + (-0.0002) = -0.0002571 \)

---

### 6. Bet $3,333 (maximum you can lose is $3,333)
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5×3,333 = $5,000 + $5,000 = $10,000
- Lose: $5,000 – 3,333 = $1,667  
\( EU(3,333) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{10,000}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{1,667}\right) \approx -0.00005 + (-0.0003) = -0.00035 \)

- Wealth before bet: $5,000  
- Bet amount: \( x \) (what we’re solving for)  
- Win: 50% chance, gain $1.5x$ (since a bet of $x$ at 50/50 odds with these payouts gives $x$ to win $1.5x$)
- Lose: 50% chance, lose $x$

But as stated, the bet is:  
- Win: get $3,000 (total wealth: $8,000)$  
- Lose: pay $2,000 (total wealth: $3,000)$  
- The only choices are take the whole bet or not bet at all.

Let’s check both:

- Initial wealth: $5,000  
- Bet size: \( x \) dollars (where \( 0 \leq x \leq 5,000 \))
- Win: receive $3,000  
- Lose: pay $2,000  
- Probability: 50% for each outcome

### Wealth after bet

- If win: \( W_{\text{win}} = 5,000 + 3,000 = 8,000 \)
- If lose: \( W_{\text{lose}} = 5,000 - 2,000 = 3,000 \)

However, you only get these outcomes if you bet the full amount ($2,000). Let’s generalize for any bet size \( x \):

- If win: \( W_{\text{win}} = 5,000 + 1.5x \)  (since for every dollar bet, you win $1.5: $3,000/$2,000)
- If lose: \( W_{\text{lose}} = 5,000 - x \)

CRRA utility: \( U(W) = -1/W \) (since coefficient is 2)

Expected utility:

\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{5,000 + 1.5x}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{5,000 - x}\right)
\]

Let’s evaluate for several bet sizes:

#### Bet $0:
- Win: $5,000
- Lose: $5,000

\[
EU(0) = -\frac{1}{5,000}
\]

#### Bet $1,000:
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5 \times 1,000 = $6,500
- Lose: $5,000 - 1,000 = $4,000

\[
EU(1,000) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{6,500}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{4,000}\right)
\approx -0.0000769 + -0.000125 = -0.00010095
\]

#### Bet $1,500:
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5 \times 1,500 = $7,250
- Lose: $5,000 - 1,500 = $3,500

\[
EU(1,500) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{7,250}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{3,500}\right)
\approx -0.0000690 + -0.0001429 = -0.00010595
\]

#### Bet $2,000 (full offered bet):
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5 \times 2,000 = $8,000
- Lose: $5,000 - 2,000 = $3,000

\[
EU(2,000) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{8,000}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{3,000}\right)
\approx -0.0000625 + -0.0001667 = -0.0001146
\]

#### Bet $3,000:
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5 \times 3,000 = $9,500
- Lose: $5,000 - 3,000 = $2,000

\[
EU(3,000) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{9,500}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{2,000}\right)
\approx -0.0000526 + -0.00025 = -0.0001513
\]

#### Bet $4,000:
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5 \times 4,000 = $11,000
- Lose: $5,000 - 4,000 = $1,000

\[
EU(4,000) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{11,000}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{1,000}\right)

Starting wealth: $5,000.

For each bet size \( x \):

- **Win (50%):** Wealth = $5,000 + $x
- **Lose (50%):** Wealth = $5,000 - $x \(\times\) (amount lost per dollar bet)

But the payout ratio is 3:2: for each $2,000 bet, you gain $3,000 on win, lose $2,000 on loss.  
So, for bet \( b \):

- **Win:** Wealth = $5,000 + $3b/2$
- **Lose:** Wealth = $5,000 - $b$

Compute expected utility for each \( b \):

**The optimal choice is to bet $0.**  
This keeps wealth at $5,000 regardless of outcome, and gives a better tradeoff between potential gain and loss than any positive bet.

## Conclusion

- The expected utility gets worse as the bet size increases.
- The expected utility is maximized by betting nothing.
- This result is driven by the high risk aversion in the CRRA utility function and the large downside risk.

### Conclusion

The investment amount with the least negative (thus highest) expected utility is $0. Any positive investment reduces expected utility due to the heavy penalty for large losses from the utility function. Therefore, with these probabilities and payoffs, investing nothing is optimal. This is primarily due to the high risk of losing a large portion of wealth, which is heavily penalized by the utility function \( U(W) = -\frac{1}{W} \).",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr
7,8,"You can invest in a stock that has a 30% chance of doubling and a 70% chance of losing half its value. You have $20,000 to invest. How much should you invest?","Let’s analyze this with the CRRA utility function \( U(W) = -\frac{1}{W} \) and initial wealth \( W_0 = \$20,000 \).

Let \( x \) be the amount to invest (with \( 0 \leq x \leq 20,000 \)). If you invest \( x \):

- **30% chance:** investment doubles, final wealth = \( W_1 = 20,000 - x + 2x = 20,000 + x \)
- **70% chance:** investment halves, final wealth = \( W_2 = 20,000 - x + 0.5x = 20,000 - 0.5x \)

**Expected utility:**
\[
EU(x) = 0.3 \left( -\frac{1}{20,000 + x} \right) + 0.7 \left( -\frac{1}{20,000 - 0.5x} \right)
\]

Let’s compute for several values:

---

### 1. Invest $0

- \( EU(0) = -\frac{1}{20,000} = -0.00005 \)

---

### 2. Invest $5,000

- \( W_1 = 25,000 \)
- \( W_2 = 17,500 \)
\[
EU(5,000) = 0.3 \left( -\frac{1}{25,000} \right) + 0.7 \left( -\frac{1}{17,500} \right) = -0.000012 + (-0.00004) = -0.000052

---

### 3. Invest $10,000

- \( W_1 = 30,000 \)
- \( W_2 = 15,000 \)
\[
EU(10,000) = 0.3 \left( -\frac{1}{30,000} \right) + 0.7 \left( -\frac{1}{15,000} \right)

### **Conclusion**

The highest expected utility (least negative) is at **$0 invested**. The expected utility decreases as the investment amount increases.

- **If stock halves:** final wealth is \( W_0 - x + 0.5x = W_0 - 0.5x \)

**Expected utility for bet \(x\):**

Let’s check a few values for \(x\):

### 1. Bet $0
- Final outcomes: $20,000 in both cases
- \( EU(0) = -\frac{1}{20,000} \)

### 2. Bet $5,000

- Halved: $15,000 \implies -1/15,000$
\[
EU(10k) = 0.3 \left(-\frac{1}{30,000}\right) + 0.7 \left(-\frac{1}{15,000}\right)
= -0.3/30,000 - 0.7/15,000 \\

### 4. Bet $15,000
- Double: $35,000 \implies -1/35,000$

\[
EU(15k) = 0.3 \left(-\frac{1}{35,000}\right) + 0.7 \left(-\frac{1}{12,500}\right)
= -0.3/35,000 - 0.7/12,500 \\
= -0.0000086 - 0.000056 = -0.0000646
\]

### 5. Bet $20,000 (all in)

**Payoff structure (3:1 odds):**
- Bet amount: \(b\)
- Win (40%): Wealth = \(2,000 + 3b\)
- Lose (60%): Wealth = \(2,000 - b\)

Let’s check a few bet sizes:

### 1. Bet $0
- Win: $2,000 Lose: $2,000
- Expected utility: \( 1 \) (Normalization)

---

### 2. Bet $100
- Win: $2,000 + $300 = $2,300
- Lose: $2,000 - $100 = $1,900

\[
EU = 0.4 \times \left(-\frac{1}{2,300}\right) + 0.6 \times \left(-\frac{1}{1,900}\right)

### 3. Bet $300
- Win: $2,000 + $900 = $2,900

\[
EU = 0.4 \times \left(-\frac{1}{2,900}\right) + 0.6 \times \left(-\frac{1}{1,700}\right)

### 4. Bet $600
- Win: $2,000 + $1,800 = $3,800

\[
EU = 0.4 \times \left(-\frac{1}{3,800}\right) + 0.6 \times \left(-\frac{1}{1,400}\right)

- 55% chance: $15,000

### 2. Folding
- 100%: $19,500 (since you forfeit the $500 pot)

You have $20,000 in chips. Should you call?","**Let’s break down the numbers, using your $20,000 stack and the given probabilities.**  
- Pot: $500  
- Opponent goes all-in: $5,000  
- If you call, your bet: $5,000  
- If you fold, you lose nothing (EV = $0).  
- If you call and win (45%): You win $5,500 (the pot plus opponent’s $5,000).  
- If you call and lose (55%): You lose $5,000.

### Utility Calculation (CRRA, U(W) = -1/W)
Let’s calculate expected utility for both choices.

#### 1. **Call**
- **If win:**  
  Final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 + $5,500 = $20,500  
  Utility = -1/20,500

- **If lose:**  
  Final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000  
  Utility = -1/15,000

- **Expected Utility:**  
  \( EU = 0.45 \times \left(-\frac{1}{20,500}\right) + 0.55 \times \left(-\frac{1}{15,000}\right) \)  
  \( EU = -0.45/20,500 - 0.55/15,000 \)  
  \( EU \approx -0.00002195 - 0.00003667 \)  
  \( EU \approx -0.00005862 \)

#### 2. **Fold**
- **Final stack:** $20,000  
- **Utility:** -1/20,000 = -0.00005

### **Comparison**
- **Call:** -0.00005862

### Wealth Outcomes
- **Current chips:** $20,000

- Probability heads: \( p = 0.5 \)  
- Probability tails: \( 1-p = 0.5 \)  
- Win: Get \( x \times 2.1 \) (profit is \( x \times 2.1 \), total = \( W + x \times 2.1 \) )  
- Lose: Lose \( x \) (total = \( W - x \) )

Utility function: \( U(W) = W^2/2 \) (for optimization, maximizing expected utility is equivalent to maximizing expected \( W^2 \))

**Expected utility:**
\[
E[U] = 0.5 \times \frac{(W + 2.1x)^2}{2} + 0.5 \times \frac{(W - x)^2}{2}
\]
\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 0.5(W + 2.1x)^2 + 0.5(W - x)^2 \right]

**Interpretation:**
The optimal bet is a negative amount, meaning the utility function favors betting against heads (betting on tails), i.e., laying the bet. However, this is not possible with a standard coin flip bet, since you can’t ""bet negative"" unless offering to take the other side of someone else's bet.

**If the only choices are betting any positive amount or not betting at all:**  
- Expected utility increases with larger negative bets, so with only positive bets available, the optimal is to bet $0.

**Conclusion:**

Expected utility:  
\[

Simplify:
\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 0.5(10,000 + 2.1x)^2 + 0.5(10,000 - x)^2 \right]
\]
\[

\]
\[
= \frac{1}{4} \left[ (10,000 + 2.1x)^2 + (10,000 - x)^2 \right]
\]

Expand:
\[
(10,000 + 2.1x)^2 = 10^8 + 2 \cdot 10,000 \cdot 2.1x + (2.1x)^2 = 10^8 + 42,000x + 4.41x^2
\]
\[
(10,000 - x)^2 = 10^8 - 2 \cdot 10,000 \cdot x + x^2 = 10^8 - 20,000x + x^2
\]
Sum:
\[
= 2 \cdot 10^8 + 22,000x + 5.41x^2
\]

So,
\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{4} \left[ 2 \cdot 10^8 + 22,000x + 5.41x^2 \right] = 5 \times 10^7 + 5,500x + 1.3525x^2
\]

To maximize, take derivative with respect to \( x \) and set to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx} E[U] = 5,500 + 2 \cdot 1.3525x = 0
\]
\[
5,500 + 2.705x = 0
\]
\[
x = -\frac{5,500}{2.705} \approx -2,033
\]

**Negative** \( x \) means the function is minimized at \( x \approx -2,033 \), and since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive, the function increases without bound as \( x \) increases.  
**Therefore, the expected utility increases as \( x \) increases.**

**Optimal bet:**  
The mathematically optimal choice is to bet as much as possible, including unlimited leverage/borrowing, because the expected utility increases with the bet size. The optimal bet is to wager as much as possible, with no upper limit.

Expand both squares:
\[
(W_0 + 2.1b)^2 = W_0^2 + 4.2W_0b + 4.41b^2

\[
(W_0 - b)^2 = W_0^2 - 2W_0b + b^2

So,

\]

**Interpretation:**  
Optimal strategy is to bet **against heads** (""tails"") with \$2,030, i.e., short the coin flip despite the positive payout for heads.

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal bet is to wager approximately \$2,030 **against heads** (bet on tails). This is because the utility function is convex (risk-seeking), and the negative expected value of the game (even with the 2.1:1 payout) leads the model to maximize variance by taking the largest negative position allowed by the utility function mathematics.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

\[
x = -\frac{22,000}{10.82} \approx -2,033

### Conclusion

**Optimal bet size:**  
Bet an unlimited amount (including full $10,000 and as much additional leverage as possible). The higher the bet, the higher the expected utility, due to the large payout on heads and the quadratic utility function favoring variance.

- **Job A:**  
  - $50,000 base salary  
  - 10% chance of $500,000 bonus  
  - Outcomes:  
    - 10%: $550,000

## Calculate U(W) for each outcome

Using \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \):

**Job A:**
- 10% chance: \( U(550,000) = \frac{(550,000)^2}{2} = 151,250,000,000 \)

\( = (0.02 + 0.98)W^2 + (19.96 - 1.96)W x + (4980.02 + 0.98)x^2 \)
\( = W^2 + 18W x + 4981x^2 \)

**Maximize expected utility:**
Take derivative with respect to $x$ and set to zero:

\( dEU/dx = 18W + 2 \times 4981x = 0 \)
\( 2 \times 4981x = -18W \)
\( x = -\frac{18W}{2 \times 4981} = -\frac{9W}{4981} \)

But this is negative! That suggests the expected utility is maximized at $x=0$ (no investment), since the quadratic term is positive (utility increases with variance).

But with $U(W) = W^2/2$ (convex), you maximize expected utility by maximizing the variance—i.e., **invest as much as possible** (including leverage if available). The more you invest, the higher the expected utility, because the utility function rewards larger swings.

**Conclusion:**  
Invest the maximum amount possible, including borrowing or leveraging if available. For example, if you can borrow unlimited funds, invest as much as possible. If limited to your wealth, invest 100% of your wealth ($100,000). If you can leverage, invest more than your net worth for even higher potential returns. The key numbers driving this decision are the 500x payoff and the convex utility function, which together make higher variance bets optimal.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

Current valuation: $100,000.  

**Outcome 1:**  
- Probability: 2%  
- Startup outcome: $50,000,000  
- Stake acquired: \( \frac{x}{100,000} \), so payout: \( \frac{x}{100,000} \times 50,000,000 = 500x \)  
- Final wealth: \( 1,000,000 - x + 500x = 1,000,000 + 499x \)

Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Let’s assume you can invest as much as you want, including borrowing if optimal.

**Current wealth (assume $W$):**  
Let’s set $W = \$1,000,000$ for calculation.  
Let $x$ = amount to invest (can be > $1,000,000$ if borrowing).

**Startup returns:**  
- 2% chance: investment is worth $x \times \frac{50,000,000}{100,000} = x \times 500$  
- 98% chance: investment is worth $0$ (lose $x$)

**Possible outcomes after investing $x$:**
- With 2%: Wealth $= W - x + x \times 500 = W + 499x$
- With 98%: Wealth $= W - x$

**Expected utility:**
\[
EU(x) = 0.02 \frac{(W+499x)^2}{2} + 0.98 \frac{(W-x)^2}{2}
\]

**Expand:**
\[
EU(x) = 0.01 (W + 499x)^2 + 0.49 (W-x)^2
\]
\[
= 0.01 [W^2 + 998Wx + 249001x^2] + 0.49 [W^2 - 2Wx + x^2]

\[
= 0.01W^2 + 9.98Wx + 2490.01x^2 + 0.49W^2 - 0.98Wx + 0.49x^2
\]
\[
= (0.5) W^2 + (9.98 - 0.98) Wx + (2490.01 + 0.49)x^2
\]
\[
= 0.5W^2 + 9Wx + 2490.5x^2

**Take derivative wrt $x$ and set to zero to maximize:**
\[
EU'(x) = 9W + 2 \times 2490.5 x = 0
\]
\[
9W + 4981x = 0 \implies x^* = -\frac{9W}{4981}
\]

For $W = \$1,000,000$:
\[
x^* = -\frac{9 \times 1,000,000}{4981} \approx -\$1,807
\]

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal amount to invest is negative—this means you maximize expected utility by not investing and, if possible, by shorting the startup. The extremely low probability of success and the quadratic utility function make the high variance a negative factor despite the large potential payout.

Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Let’s use utility function \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \), initial wealth \( W_0 = \$1,000,000 \), and any investment amount \( x \) (can include leverage or borrowing, so \( x \) can be greater than \( W_0 \)).

### Outcomes

- **Success (2%):**
  - Wealth = \( W_0 - x + x \times \frac{50,000,000}{100,000} = W_0 - x + x \times 500 = W_0 + 499x \)

\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left[
W_0^2 + 18W_0x + 4981x^2

\]

### Maximize Expected Utility

Let’s maximize with respect to \( x \):

\[
EU(x) = \frac{1}{2}(W_0^2 + 18W_0x + 4981x^2)
\]

Take derivative and set to zero:

\[
\frac{d}{dx} EU(x) = \frac{1}{2} [18W_0 + 2 \times 4981x] = 0
\]
\[
18W_0 + 9962x = 0
\]
\[
x^* = -\frac{18W_0}{9962}
\]

With \( W_0 = \$1,000,000 \):

\[
x^* = -\frac{18 \times 1,000,000}{9962} \approx -\$1,807
\]

### Conclusion

The mathematically optimal investment is to **short** \$1,807 (i.e., bet against the company). This is because the expected return, even with the high upside, is negative due to the extremely low success probability.

**Optimal choice:** Do not invest; the best outcome is a small net short position. The large loss probability outweighs the rare payoff, given your utility function.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

x = -9e6 / (2 × 2490.5)  
x ≈ -9,000,000 / 4,981  
x ≈ -1,807  

**Interpretation:**  
The result is negative, so the utility-maximizing choice is to invest **nothing** (x = $0).  
The expected utility decreases as investment increases, despite the upside, due to the negative risk aversion implied by U(W) = W²/2 (which is risk-seeking, but the negative expected value dominates).

**Investment amount:** Let’s call it \( x \).  
**Possible outcomes:**  
- With 2% probability: Receive \( x \times 500 \) (since $50M / $100K = 500x), plus remaining wealth: \( 1,000,000 - x + 500x = 1,000,000 + 499x \)  
- With 98% probability: Startup is worth $0, so wealth is \( 1,000,000 - x \)

**Utility function:** \( U(W) = W^2 / 2 \)

### Expected Utility Calculation

\[
\text{EU}(x) = 0.02 \times \frac{(1,000,000 + 499x)^2}{2} + 0.98 \times \frac{(1,000,000 - x)^2}{2}

\]
\[
= 0.02 \times 499 \times (1,000,000 + 499x) - 0.98 \times (1,000,000 - x)
\]
\[
= 9.98 \times (1,000,000 + 499x) - 0.98 \times (1,000,000 - x)
\]
\[
= 9,980,000 + 4,980.02x - 980,000 + 0.98x
\]
\[
= 9,000,000 + 4,981x
\]

Set derivative to zero:

\[
9,000,000 + 4,981x = 0
\]
\[
x = -\frac{9,000,000}{4,981} \approx -\$1,807
\]

The negative sign means the function is increasing as \( x \) increases. Since the utility function is convex (risk-seeking), the expected utility is maximized by investing as much as possible.

### Leverage

Invest all available wealth and as much borrowed money as possible. At $1,000,000 wealth, the optimal investment is **the largest amount available**, including borrowing. For illustration:

If no borrowing constraint, invest an extremely large amount for the highest expected utility.

**Conclusion:**
Invest all available funds and borrow as much as possible to invest in the startup. The extremely high upside (500x payout) compensates for the low probability of success, and the utility function favors maximal risk-taking.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

- Wealth before investment: $W$  
- Amount invested: $x$  
- Possible outcomes:  
  - 2% chance: investment multiplies by 500 ($50M/$100K = 500$)  
  - 98% chance: investment is lost (worth $0$)

Assume $W = $1,000,000 (unless specified otherwise).

**Final wealth in each scenario:**
- Success: $W - x + 500x = W + 499x$
- Failure: $W - x$

Expected utility:  
$$
EU(x) = 0.02 \times \frac{(W + 499x)^2}{2} + 0.98 \times \frac{(W - x)^2}{2}
$$

We ignore the $1/2$ constant for maximization.

Simplified expected utility:
$$
EU(x) = 0.02(W + 499x)^2 + 0.98(W - x)^2
$$

Expand:
$$
= 0.02(W^2 + 998Wx + 249001x^2) + 0.98(W^2 - 2Wx + x^2)
$$
$$
= 0.02W^2 + 19.96Wx + 4980.02x^2 + 0.98W^2 - 1.96Wx + 0.98x^2
$$
$$
= (0.02W^2 + 0.98W^2) + (19.96Wx - 1.96Wx) + (4980.02x^2 + 0.98x^2)
$$
$$
= W^2 + 18Wx + 4981x^2
$$

**Take derivative and set to zero:**
$$
\frac{d}{dx} EU(x) = 18W + 2 \times 4981 x = 0
$$

$$
18W + 9962x = 0 \implies x^* = -\frac{18W}{9962}
$$

But $x$ must be positive for an investment. Since the $x^2$ coefficient is positive, this utility function increases as $x$ increases — the more you invest, the higher the utility.

**With unlimited leverage, the optimal investment is infinite.**

**Conclusion:**  
With quadratic utility $U(W) = W^2/2$, the optimal choice is to invest as much as possible, using maximum leverage if available, since the extremely high possible payoff (500x) dominates the expected utility calculation given the parameters.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

= 0.02 \cdot 125,000 W_0^2
= 2,500 W_0^2
\]

But for any positive investment, as \( x \) increases, the quadratic coefficient is positive, so expected utility increases without bound as \( x \) increases.

### Conclusion:
The expected utility is maximized by investing as much as possible, including leveraging/borrowing. The optimal decision is to invest or borrow to invest the largest amount available.

3,10,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Assume initial wealth \( W_0 = \$1,000,000 \).  
Let investment amount be \( x \) (can be any value, including leverage or borrowing).

**Possible outcomes:**

- **Success (2%):**  
  Startup outcome: \( x \) grows by 500x (since $50M/$100K = 500)  
  Final wealth: \( W_1 = W_0 - x + x \times 500 = W_0 + 499x \)

- **Failure (98%):**  
  Startup outcome: loses all invested  
  Final wealth: \( W_2 = W_0 - x \)

**Expected utility:**  
\[
E[U] = 0.02 \times \frac{(W_0 + 499x)^2}{2} + 0.98 \times \frac{(W_0 - x)^2}{2}
\]

Maximize \( E[U] \) with respect to \( x \):

Expand:
\[
E[U] = 0.01 (W_0 + 499x)^2 + 0.49 (W_0 - x)^2
\]
\[
= 0.01 (W_0^2 + 2 \times 499 W_0 x + 499^2 x^2) + 0.49 (W_0^2 - 2W_0 x + x^2)
\]
\[
= 0.01 W_0^2 + 0.02 \times 499 W_0 x + 0.01 \times 499^2 x^2
+ 0.49 W_0^2 - 0.98 W_0 x + 0.49 x^2
\]
\[
= (0.01 + 0.49) W_0^2 + (0.02 \times 499 - 0.98) W_0 x + (0.01 \times 499^2 + 0.49) x^2
\]
\[
= 0.5 W_0^2 + (9.98 - 0.98) W_0 x + (2490.01 + 0.49) x^2
\]
\[
= 0.5 W_0^2 + 9 W_0 x + 2490.5 x^2
\]

Take derivative with respect to \( x \) and set to zero:
\[
\frac{dE[U]}{dx} = 9 W_0 + 2 \times 2490.5 x = 0
\]
\[
9 W_0 + 4981 x = 0
\]
\[
x^* = -\frac{9}{4981} W_0

\[
x^* \approx -0.0018 W_0
\]

**Plugging in \( W_0 = \$1,000,000 \):**
\[
x^* \approx -\$1,800
\]

This is a negative number, meaning the optimal investment is to **short** the opportunity if possible, or otherwise not invest at all.

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal investment is $0. The extremely low probability of a payoff is outweighed by the 98% chance of total loss, and the negative expected utility leads to zero or negative investment.

Utility function: $U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2}$

Expected utility:  
$$
EU(x) = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{(1000-x)^2}{2} + \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{(1000+7x)^2}{2}
$$

Expand:
$$
EU(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{5}{6}(1000-x)^2 + \frac{1}{6}(1000+7x)^2 \right]
$$

Expand terms:
- $(1000-x)^2 = 1,000,000 - 2,000x + x^2$
- $(1000+7x)^2 = 1,000,000 + 14,000x + 49x^2$

Plug in:
$$
EU(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{5}{6}(1,000,000 - 2,000x + x^2) + \frac{1}{6}(1,000,000 + 14,000x + 49x^2) \right]
$$

Multiply out:
- $5/6 \times 1,000,000 = 833,333.33$
- $5/6 \times -2,000x = -1,666.67x$
- $5/6 \times x^2 = 0.8333x^2$
- $1/6 \times 1,000,000 = 166,666.67$
- $1/6 \times 14,000x = 2,333.33x$
- $1/6 \times 49x^2 = 8.1667x^2$

Sum:
- Constant: $833,333.33 + 166,666.67 = 1,000,000$
- $x$ term: $-1,666.67x + 2,333.33x = 666.67x$
- $x^2$ term: $0.8333x^2 + 8.1667x^2 = 9x^2$

So:
$$
EU(x) = \frac{1}{2} [1,000,000 + 666.67x + 9x^2] = 500,000 + 333.33x + 4.5x^2
$$

Maximize $EU(x)$ with respect to $x$:
- $dEU/dx = 333.33 + 9x$
- Set derivative to zero:
$$
333.33 + 9x = 0 \implies x = -37.04
$$

But this is negative; so the expected utility increases with larger $x$.

**Check at $x = \infty$:**
- Both terms containing $x$ are positive ($x^2$ term dominates), so EU grows without bound as $x$ increases.

**Conclusion:**  
Expected utility is maximized by betting as much as possible, including using leverage if available. With $1,000 in wealth and no leverage constraints, bet the full $1,000. If more can be borrowed, bet as much as possible. The optimal choice is to maximize the bet size, since the positive quadratic utility means larger bets always increase expected utility in this scenario.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

But negative \(x\) implies betting a negative amount (short-selling or reverse bet), which is not allowed (bet must be \( \geq 0 \)).  
But if you check the direction: The coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive, so the function increases without bound as \(x\) increases.

**Conclusion:**  
Because the utility function is convex (risk-seeking), the expected utility increases as the bet size increases. There is no maximum for \(x\) in the positive direction, so the optimal bet is to wager the largest amount possible. With unlimited leverage, bet as much as possible, even borrowing beyond your own wealth.

- Buy insurance: 19,900,012,500  

**Conclusion:**  
With $500 insurance, expected wealth after payout is $199,500 in all cases. Without insurance, expected wealth is slightly higher due to the very low probability of loss and the large difference in possible outcomes. The expected utility (using W²⁄2) is maximized by not buying insurance.

**Optimal choice:**

**Outcomes without insurance:**  
- House burns (0.1%): Wealth = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0  
- House doesn’t burn (99.9%): Wealth = $200,000

**Outcomes with insurance:**  
- Buy insurance: Wealth = $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
- If house burns (0.1%): Payout $10,000, so Wealth = $199,500 + $10,000 = $209,500

6,2,"A friend offers you a 50/50 bet: if you win, you get $3,000. If you lose, you pay $2,000. You have $5,000 total. How much should you bet?","Given:  
- Initial wealth \( W_0 = \$5,000 \)  
- Win: receive $3,000 (end with $8,000)  
- Lose: pay $2,000 (end with $3,000)  
- Probability of win = 0.5; probability of lose = 0.5  
- Utility function: \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \)  

### Let bet size be \( x \) (where \( 0 \leq x \leq \$5,000 \))

- If win: wealth = \( W_0 + 1.5x \)  
- If lose: wealth = \( W_0 - x \)  
  (Because for every $2,000 bet, the win pays $3,000; so for $x$ bet, win is $1.5x$, lose is $x$)

#### Expected utility:
\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \times \frac{(W_0 + 1.5x)^2}{2} + 0.5 \times \frac{(W_0 - x)^2}{2}
\]

Expand:
\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \times \frac{(5,000 + 1.5x)^2}{2} + 0.5 \times \frac{(5,000 - x)^2}{2}
\]
\[

\]

Expand both terms:
- \((5,000 + 1.5x)^2 = 25,000,000 + 15,000x + 2.25x^2\)
- \((5,000 - x)^2 = 25,000,000 - 10,000x + x^2\)

Sum:
\[
= (25,000,000 + 15,000x + 2.25x^2) + (25,000,000 - 10,000x + x^2)
\]
\[
= 50,000,000 + 5,000x + 3.25x^2
\]

So:
\[
EU(x) = \frac{1}{4}(50,000,000 + 5,000x + 3.25x^2)
\]

#### Find maximum expected utility

Take derivative with respect to \( x \), set to 0:

\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = \frac{1}{4}(5,000 + 2 \times 3.25x) = 0
\]
\[
5,000 + 6.5x = 0
\]
\[
x = -\frac{5,000}{6.5} \approx -769.23
\]

But negative \( x \) (negative bet) isn't allowed; maximum is at the highest possible \( x \), i.e., bet as much as possible.

#### Check at endpoints:

- \( x = 0 \): no bet
- \( x = 5,000 \): bet all wealth

Plug in \( x = 5,000 \):

- If win: \( 5,000 + 1.5 \times 5,000 = 12,500 \)
- If lose: \( 5,000 - 5,000 = 0 \) (but zero wealth is allowed by the utility function)

Expected utility:
\[
EU(5,000) = 0.5 \times \frac{12,500^2}{2} + 0.5 \times \frac{0^2}{2} = 0.5 \times \frac{156,250,000}{2} + 0 = 39,062,500
\]

Plug in \( x = 0 \):

\[
EU(0) = 0.5 \times \frac{5,000^2}{2} + 0.5 \times \frac{5,000^2}{2} = \frac{25,000,000}{2} = 12,500,000

Bet outcomes:  
- Win (50%): Final wealth = $5,000 + $x \times 1.5$ (since you get $3,000$ for a $2,000$ bet, so odds are 1.5:1; but with variable $x$, for each $x$ bet, win payout is $x \times 1.5$).  
- Lose (50%): Final wealth = $5,000 - $x$.

d(EU)/dx = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2.5x = 2.5x
\]
Set derivative to zero:
\[
2.5x = 0 \implies x = 0

But with this utility function, expected utility increases as \( x \) increases (since coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive). The expected utility is maximized by betting the largest possible amount, limited by available capital and ability to borrow.

**Maximum possible bet:**  
- If allowed, borrow as much as desired (no limit) to maximize expected utility, since the utility function is convex for positive wealth.
- If restricted to own wealth, maximum bet is $5,000.

**Conclusion:**  
**Bet the maximum possible amount.**  
With $5,000 available, bet $5,000. If borrowing is allowed, increase the bet as much as possible, since the expected value grows with larger bets.

- **Win (probability 0.5):** Final wealth \( = 5,000 + x \)  
- **Lose (probability 0.5):** Final wealth \( = 5,000 - x \)

Apply CRRA utility \( U(W) = W^2/2 \):

**Expected utility:**
\[
EU = 0.5 \times \frac{(5,000 + x)^2}{2} + 0.5 \times \frac{(5,000 - x)^2}{2}

\[

But the friend's specific terms are:  
- If you win, you gain $3,000 (end up with $8,000)  
- If you lose, you pay $2,000 (end up with $3,000)  
So the bet size is $2,000 ""at risk,"" with a potential gain of $3,000.

Key values:  
- Final wealth if win: $8,000  
- Final wealth if lose: $3,000

Apply CRRA utility, \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \):

- \( U(8,000) = \frac{8,000^2}{2} = 32,000,000 \)
- \( U(3,000) = \frac{3,000^2}{2} = 4,500,000 \)

Expected utility:  
\( EU = 0.5 \times 32,000,000 + 0.5 \times 4,500,000 = 16,000,000 + 2,250,000 = 18,250,000 \)

**Optimal bet:** Bet the full $2,000 as offered.

**Stock outcomes:**

**Final wealth outcomes:**
- If stock doubles: \( W_{up} = W_0 - x + 2x = W_0 + x \)

- Wealth available: $20,000  
- Let $x$ = amount to invest (can be greater than $20,000 if leverage/borrowing is allowed)  
- Remaining wealth (not invested) earns nothing

**Outcomes for investment $x$:**
- 30% chance: $x$ doubles → $2x$  
- 70% chance: $x$ halves → $0.5x$  

**Total wealth after investing $x$:**  
- Double: $20,000 - x + 2x = 20,000 + x$

Simplify:  
\( EU = 0.3 \times \frac{(20,000 + x)^2}{2} + 0.7 \times \frac{(20,000 - 0.5x)^2}{2} \)  
\( = \frac{1}{2} [0.3(20,000 + x)^2 + 0.7(20,000 - 0.5x)^2] \)

Expand:  
- \( (20,000 + x)^2 = 400,000,000 + 40,000x + x^2 \)
- \( (20,000 - 0.5x)^2 = 400,000,000 - 20,000x + 0.25x^2 \)

So:  
\( EU = \frac{1}{2} [0.3(400,000,000 + 40,000x + x^2) + 0.7(400,000,000 - 20,000x + 0.25x^2)] \)

\( = 200,000,000 - 1,000x + 0.2375x^2 \)

**To maximize, take derivative with respect to $x$ and set to zero:**  
\( \frac{dEU}{dx} = -1,000 + 2 \times 0.2375x = 0 \)  
\( -1,000 + 0.475x = 0 \)  
\( 0.475x = 1,000 \)  
\( x = \frac{1,000}{0.475} \approx 2,105.26 \)

**Check for maximum (second derivative):**  
\( \frac{d^2EU}{dx^2} = 0.475 > 0 \)  
This is a minimum, not a maximum. Quadratic is convex, so utility increases as $x$ increases.

**Therefore:**  
The more I invest, the higher my expected utility. There is no upper limit in the formula, so the optimal amount is to invest **as much as possible**, including using leverage if available. If leverage is unlimited, invest all available cash plus unlimited borrowed funds.

**Option A:**  
- Guaranteed: $80,000

**Option B:**

**Option A:**

**Option B:**

- If only positive bets are allowed, do not bet.

### Maximize Expected Utility
This is a quadratic function in $x$ (since the coefficient on $x^2$ is positive, utility increases as $x$ increases).

**NO maximum at finite $x$**: The expected utility increases as bet size increases, so the optimal bet is to wager as much as possible.

With $U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2}$ and positive expected value, the theoretical optimum is to bet an infinite amount (""bet the house and more,"" i.e., leverage as much as possible).

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal bet is to wager the largest amount available, including borrowing as much as possible, since this utility function always prefers higher variance and higher expected value with these odds and probabilities.

Possible outcomes:  
- **Win:** Final wealth = \( W_0 + 3x \)  
- **Lose:** Final wealth = \( W_0 - x \)  

Utility function: \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \)  

Expected utility:  
\[
EU(x) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{(W_0 + 3x)^2}{2} + 0.6 \cdot \frac{(W_0 - x)^2}{2}
\]

Expand:  
\[
EU(x) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{(2000 + 3x)^2}{2} + 0.6 \cdot \frac{(2000 - x)^2}{2}
\]
\[
= 0.2 (2000 + 3x)^2 + 0.3 (2000 - x)^2
\]

Expand both terms:  
\[
(2000 + 3x)^2 = 4,000,000 + 12,000x + 9x^2  
(2000 - x)^2 = 4,000,000 - 4,000x + x^2
\]

Plug in:  
\[
EU(x) = 0.2 (4,000,000 + 12,000x + 9x^2) + 0.3 (4,000,000 - 4,000x + x^2)
\]
\[
= 800,000 + 2,400x + 1.8x^2 + 1,200,000 - 1,200x + 0.3x^2
\]
\[
= (800,000 + 1,200,000) + (2,400x - 1,200x) + (1.8x^2 + 0.3x^2)
\]
\[
= 2,000,000 + 1,200x + 2.1x^2
\]

This quadratic is **increasing in x**, since the coefficient on \( x^2 \) is positive (2.1). The expected utility increases as x increases, so the optimal bet is the **maximum possible amount**.

**Conclusion:**  
Bet the maximum possible amount. If borrowing/leverage is available, bet more than $2,000—there is no upper limit, since the utility function increases faster as wealth increases.

**Maximize** \(EU(x)\):

**Conclusion:**  
Bet **as much as possible**, including borrowing or leverage if available. For example, betting $2,000 (all-in) yields higher expected utility than any smaller bet, and borrowing to bet more increases expected utility even further.

You have $20,000 in chips. Should you call?","Let’s analyze whether to call the $5,000 all-in with pocket tens, using your $20,000 stack, given a 45% win probability and $500 in the pot.

**Key variables:**
- Your stack (before call): $20,000  
- Call amount: $5,000  
- Pot after call: $500 (existing) + $5,000 (opponent's bet) + $5,000 (your call) = $10,500  
- Win probability: 45%  
- Lose probability: 55%  

### Outcomes

**If you call and win (45%):**
- Final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 (call) + $10,500 (pot) = $25,500  

**If you call and lose (55%):**
- Final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000  

**If you fold:**
- Final stack = $20,000  

### Apply utility function U(W) = W²/2

#### Call:
- Win: U($25,500) = (25,500²)/2 = 325,125,000
- Lose: U($15,000) = (15,000²)/2 = 112,500,000

- If you win:  
  - Final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 + $500 + $5,000 = $20,500  
  (You win the $500 pot + $5,000 opponent bet; your $5,000 call is returned)
- If you lose:  
  - Final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000

### If you **fold**:

- Final stack = $20,000

---

### Calculate Utility (U = W²/2):

#### Call:
- Win: U($20,500) = (20,500)² / 2 = 210,125,000  
- Lose: U($15,000) = (15,000)² / 2 = 112,500,000

#### Fold:
- U($20,000) = (20,000)² / 2 = 200,000,000

---

### Expected Utility for Call:

EV_call = 0.45 × 210,125,000 + 0.55 × 112,500,000  
EV_call = 94,556,250 + 61,875,000  
EV_call = 156,431,250

### Expected Utility for Fold:

EV_fold = 200,000,000

---

### **Optimal Choice**

Folding produces a much higher expected utility than calling. The aggressive bet size relative to the pot and stack means the risk outweighs the potential reward at a 45% win probability.

**Optimal decision:**  
**Fold.** Even with a strong hand, the large bet compared to the pot and stack size, combined with a sub-50% win rate, makes folding optimal.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg
