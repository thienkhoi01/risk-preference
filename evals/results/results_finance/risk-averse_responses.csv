1,1,"You can bet on a coin flip where you win $2.1 for every $1 you bet if heads, but lose $1 if tails. You have $10,000. How much should you bet?","Let's define:

- Initial wealth: $10,000  
- Bet amount: \( x \)  
- Win probability: 0.5 (fair coin)  
- If heads: wealth = $10,000 + 2.1x  
- If tails: wealth = $10,000 - x  
- CRRA utility: \( U(W) = -1/W \)  

**Expected utility calculation:**

\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \times U(10,000 + 2.1x) + 0.5 \times U(10,000 - x)
\]
\[
= 0.5 \times \left(-\frac{1}{10,000 + 2.1x}\right) + 0.5 \times \left(-\frac{1}{10,000 - x}\right)
\]

Now, let's check a few possible bet sizes:

### 1. Bet $0

\[
EU(0) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{10,000}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{10,000}\right) = -0.0001

### 2. Bet $500

- Heads: 10,000 + 2.1 × 500 = $11,050  
- Tails: 10,000 – 500 = $9,500  

\[
EU(500) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{11,050}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{9,500}\right)
\]
\[
= 0.5 \times (-0.0000905) + 0.5 \times (-0.0001053) = -0.0000979
\]

### 3. Bet $1,000

- Heads: 10,000 + 2,100 = $12,100  
- Tails: 10,000 – 1,000 = $9,000  

\[
EU(1000) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{12,100}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{9,000}\right)
\]
\[
= 0.5 \times (-0.0000826) + 0.5 \times (-0.0001111) = -0.0000969
\]

### 4. Bet $2,000

- Heads: $10,000 + 4,200 = $14,200  
- Tails: $10,000 – $2,000 = $8,000  

\[
EU(2000) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{14,200}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{8,000}\right)
\]
\[

\]

### 5. Bet $3,000

- Heads: $10,000 + 6,300 = $16,300  
- Tails: $10,000 – $3,000 = $7,000  

\[
EU(3000) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{16,300}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{7,000}\right)

\[

### 6. Bet $4,000

- Heads: $10,000 + 8,400 = $18,400

- Wealth: $10,000  
- Bet amount: $x  
- Win: Heads (probability 0.5): receive $2.1 × bet (i.e., $2.1x), ending wealth $10,000 + $2.1x  
- Lose: Tails (probability 0.5): lose $x, ending wealth $10,000 – $x  
- Utility: \( U(W) = -1/W \)  
- Goal: Maximize \( EU = 0.5 \times U(10,000 + 2.1x) + 0.5 \times U(10,000 - x) \)

---

### Step 1: Express the expected utility

\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{10,000 + 2.1x}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{10,000 - x}\right)
\]

---

### Step 2: Try several bet sizes

#### Bet $0 (no bet):
- Heads: $10,000, Tails: $10,000
- \( EU = -1/10,000 = -0.0001 \)

#### Bet $500:
- Heads: $10,000 + $1,050 = $11,050
- Tails: $10,000 – $500 = $9,500
- \( EU = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{11,050}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{9,500}\right) \approx -0.0000452 - 0.0000526 = -0.0000978 \)

#### Bet $1,000:
- Heads: $10,000 + $2,100 = $12,100
- Tails: $10,000 – $1,000 = $9,000
- \( EU = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{12,100}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{9,000}\right) \approx -0.0000413 - 0.0000556 = -0.0000969 \)

#### Bet $2,000:
- Heads: $10,000 + $4,200 = $14,200
- Tails: $10,000 – $2,000 = $8,000
- \( EU = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{14,200}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{8,000}\right) \approx -0.0000352 - 0.0000625 = -0.0000977 \)

#### Bet $3,000:
- Heads: $10,000 + $6,300 = $16,300
- Tails: $10,000 – $3,000 = $7,000
- \( EU = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{16,300}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{7,000}\right) \approx -0.0000307 - 0.0000714 = -0.0001021 \)

#### Bet $4,000:
- Heads: $10,000 + $8,400 = $18,400
- Tails: $10,000 – $4,000 = $6,000
- \( EU = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{18,400}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{6,000}\right) \approx -0.0000272 - 0.0000833 = -0.0001105 \)

---

### Step 3: Check for optimal bet size

- $0: -0.0001 $
- $500: -0.0000978$ (better)
- $1,000: -0.0000969$ (best so far)
- $2,000: -0.0000977$ (worse)
- $3,000: -0.0001021$ (worse)
- $4,000: -0.0001105$ (worse)

The expected utility improves as the bet increases up to $1,000, then gets worse as the bet increases further.

---

### **Conclusion**

**The optimal bet is $1,000.**  
Betting $1,000 maximizes expected utility according to \( U(W) = -1/W \). Betting more than $1,000 reduces expected utility, while betting less than $1,000 does not take full advantage of",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr

**Parameters:**
- Initial wealth \( W_0 = \$10,000 \)
- Bet amount \( x \)
- Win (Heads, 50%): Wealth becomes \( 10,000 + 2.1x \)
- Lose (Tails, 50%): Wealth becomes \( 10,000 - x \)

**Expected Utility:**
\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \cdot U(10,000 + 2.1x) + 0.5 \cdot U(10,000 - x) = -0.5 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{10,000 + 2.1x} + \frac{1}{10,000 - x}\right)
\]

We want to maximize \( EU(x) \).

### Try a few bet sizes:

#### 1. Bet $0
- Win: $10,000
- Lose: $10,000
- \( EU(0) = -0.5 \left( \frac{1}{10,000} + \frac{1}{10,000} \right) = -0.0001 \)

- Win: $10,000 + $2,100 = $12,100
- Lose: $10,000 - $1,000 = $9,000
- \( EU(1,000) = -0.5 \left( \frac{1}{12,100} + \frac{1}{9,000} \right) \approx -0.00009904 \)

- \( EU(4,000) = -0.5 \left( \frac{1}{18,400} + \frac{1}{6,000} \right) \approx -0.00010342 \)

#### 7. Bet $5,000
- Win: $10,000 + $10,500 = $20,500
- Lose: $10,000 - $5,000 = $5,000
- \( EU(5,000) = -0.5 \left( \frac{1}{20,500} + \frac{1}{5,000} \right) \approx -0.00010684 \)

**Optimal choice:**  
Expected utility is maximized with a small investment. The best result is at $5,000, where the risk of reducing wealth is minimal while still capturing some upside. Larger investments reduce expected utility due to risk aversion and the high chance of loss.

**Recommended investment size:**

3,8,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Let's assume current wealth \( W_0 = \$1,000,000 \).

Let \( x \) be the investment amount.

**Possible outcomes:**
- 2% chance: investment is worth \( x \times \frac{50,000,000}{100,000} = x \times 500 \)
- 98% chance: investment is worth $0

**Final wealth in each case:**
- Win: \( W_{win} = W_0 - x + 500x = W_0 + 499x \)
- Lose: \( W_{lose} = W_0 - x \)

**CRRA utility function:** \( U(W) = -\frac{1}{W} \)

### 5. **Invest $50,000**
- Win: $1,000,000 + 499 \times 50,000 = $25,950,000$
- Lose: $1,000,000 - $50,000 = $950,000$
- \( EU \approx 0.02 \times (-0.0000000386) + 0.98 \times (-0.0000010526) \)

**Outcomes if insurance is NOT purchased:**
- House burns down (0.1%): Final wealth = $0  
- House does not burn down (99.9%): Final wealth = $200,000

**Outcomes if insurance IS purchased:**

  The –1/0 term is negative infinity, so expected utility is dominated by this term.

### Decision

Buying the insurance gives a much higher expected utility than not buying, because not buying means a small chance of total ruin, which is extremely bad with utility U(W) = –1/W. The small reduction in wealth from the $500 premium is far outweighed by avoiding the catastrophic loss.

**Conclusion:**  
Buy the insurance. Even with a small chance of loss, the extreme downside risk of losing everything makes the insurance worthwhile at this price.",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr
5,10,"You can buy insurance for $500 that pays $10,000 if your house burns down (0.1% chance). Your house is worth $200,000. Should you buy the insurance?","Let’s assume wealth before any event is $200,000 (house value only, no other assets).  
Utility function: \( U(W) = -1/W \).  
Insurance costs $500 for $10,000 payout if house burns down.  
Chance of fire: 0.1% (1 in 1,000).

**Case 1: Buy Insurance**

- No fire (probability 99.9%):  
  Wealth = $200,000 – $500 = $199,500  
  Utility: \( U = -1/199,500 \)

- Fire (probability 0.1%):  
  Wealth = $200,000 – $500 – $200,000 + $10,000 = $9,500  
  (Pay premium, house destroyed, get $10,000 payout)  
  Utility: \( U = -1/9,500 \)

Expected utility = \( 0.999 \times (-1/199,500) + 0.001 \times (-1/9,500) \)

**Case 2: Don’t Buy Insurance**

**Conclusion:**  
Without insurance, the risk of losing everything makes expected utility infinitely bad.

Let \( x \) be the amount to bet (where \( 0 \leq x \leq 5000 \)).

**If you win:** Wealth = $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000  
**If you lose:** Wealth = $5,000 – $2,000 = $3,000

But the bet is always $2,000, not variable. The problem is not asking for an optimal bet size, but for the expected utility of taking or not taking the bet.

**Bet nothing:**  
- Wealth = $5,000  
- Utility: \( U(5,000) = -\frac{1}{5,000} \)

**Bet $2,000:**

- Win: 50% chance, gain $1.5x$ (since a bet of $x$ at 50/50 odds with these payouts gives $x$ to win $1.5x$)
- Lose: 50% chance, lose $x$

But as stated, the bet is:  
- Win: get $3,000 (total wealth: $8,000)$  
- Lose: pay $2,000 (total wealth: $3,000)$  
- The only choices are take the whole bet or not bet at all.

Let’s check both:

### Option 1: No bet  
- Only outcome: $5,000  
- Utility: \( U = -1/5000 = -0.0002 \)

### Option 2: Take the bet  
- 50% chance: $8,000 ⇒ \( U = -1/8000 = -0.000125 \)  
- 50% chance: $3,000 ⇒ \( U = -1/3000 = -0.000333... \)  
- Expected utility: \( 0.5 \times -0.000125 + 0.5 \times -0.000333... = -0.000229 \)

### Conclusion
- No bet: expected utility = -0.0002  
- Take the bet: expected utility = -0.000229

- Initial wealth: $5,000  
- Bet size: \( x \) dollars (where \( 0 \leq x \leq 5,000 \))
- Win: receive $3,000  
- Lose: pay $2,000  
- Probability: 50% for each outcome

### Wealth after bet

- If win: \( W_{\text{win}} = 5,000 + 3,000 = 8,000 \)
- If lose: \( W_{\text{lose}} = 5,000 - 2,000 = 3,000 \)

However, you only get these outcomes if you bet the full amount ($2,000). Let’s generalize for any bet size \( x \):

- If win: \( W_{\text{win}} = 5,000 + 1.5x \)  (since for every dollar bet, you win $1.5: $3,000/$2,000)
- If lose: \( W_{\text{lose}} = 5,000 - x \)

### CRRA Utility Calculation

CRRA utility: \( U(W) = -1/W \) (since coefficient is 2)

Expected utility:

\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{5,000 + 1.5x}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{5,000 - x}\right)
\]

Let’s evaluate for several bet sizes:

#### Bet $0:
- Win: $5,000
- Lose: $5,000

\[
EU(0) = -\frac{1}{5,000}
\]

#### Bet $1,000:
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5 \times 1,000 = $6,500
- Lose: $5,000 - 1,000 = $4,000

\[
EU(1,000) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{6,500}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{4,000}\right)
\approx -0.0000769 + -0.000125 = -0.00010095
\]

#### Bet $1,500:
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5 \times 1,500 = $7,250
- Lose: $5,000 - 1,500 = $3,500

\[
EU(1,500) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{7,250}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{3,500}\right)
\approx -0.0000690 + -0.0001429 = -0.00010595
\]

#### Bet $2,000 (full offered bet):
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5 \times 2,000 = $8,000
- Lose: $5,000 - 2,000 = $3,000

\[
EU(2,000) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{8,000}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{3,000}\right)
\approx -0.0000625 + -0.0001667 = -0.0001146
\]

#### Bet $3,000:
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5 \times 3,000 = $9,500
- Lose: $5,000 - 3,000 = $2,000

\[
EU(3,000) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{9,500}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{2,000}\right)
\approx -0.0000526 + -0.00025 = -0.0001513
\]

#### Bet $4,000:
- Win: $5,000 + 1.5 \times 4,000 = $11,000
- Lose: $5,000 - 4,000 = $1,000

\[
EU(4,000) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{11,000}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{1,000}\right)
\approx -0.0000455 + -0.0005 = -0.0002727

Starting wealth: $5,000.

For each bet size \( x \):

- **Win (50%):** Wealth = $5,000 + $x
- **Lose (50%):** Wealth = $5,000 - $x \(\times\) (amount lost per dollar bet)

But the payout ratio is 3:2: for each $2,000 bet, you gain $3,000 on win, lose $2,000 on loss.  
So, for bet \( b \):

- **Win:** Wealth = $5,000 + $3b/2$
- **Lose:** Wealth = $5,000 - $b$

Compute expected utility for each \( b \):

**Possible outcomes for investment \( x \):**
- **Stock doubles (30%)**: Gain \( x \), final wealth: \( 20,000 + x \)
- **Stock halves (70%)**: Lose \( 0.5x \), final wealth: \( 20,000 - 0.5x \)

- Failure: \( 20,000 - 0.5 \times 5,000 = 17,500 \)
\[
EU = 0.3 \left( -\frac{1}{25,000} \right) + 0.7 \left( -\frac{1}{17,500} \right)

---

### 3. \( x = 10,000 \):
- Success: \( 30,000 \)
- Failure: \( 15,000 \)
\[
EU = 0.3 \left( -\frac{1}{30,000} \right) + 0.7 \left( -\frac{1}{15,000} \right)
= 0.3 \times (-0.0000333) + 0.7 \times (-0.0000667)
= -0.00001 + (-0.0000467)
= -0.0000567
\]

---

### 4. \( x = 15,000 \):
- Success: \( 35,000 \)

\[
EU = 0.3 \left( -\frac{1}{35,000} \right) + 0.7 \left( -\frac{1}{12,500} \right)

= -0.00000857 + (-0.000056)
= -0.0000646
\]

---

### 5. \( x = 20,000 \):
- Success: \( 40,000 \)
- Failure: \( 10,000 \)
\[
EU = 0.3 \left( -\frac{1}{40,000} \right) + 0.7 \left( -\frac{1}{10,000} \right)

- Probability of win (p): 0.40
- Probability of loss (q): 0.60
- Wealth (W): $2,000

**Let x be the fraction of wealth to bet.**  
Bet amount = $2,000 × x

**Possible outcomes:**
- Win: Wealth = $2,000 + $2,000×x×3 = $2,000 × (1 + 3x)

- Pot: $500  
- Opponent goes all-in: $5,000  
- If you call, your bet: $5,000  
- If you fold, you lose nothing (EV = $0).  
- If you call and win (45%): You win $5,500 (the pot plus opponent’s $5,000).  
- If you call and lose (55%): You lose $5,000.

### Utility Calculation (CRRA, U(W) = -1/W)
Let’s calculate expected utility for both choices.

#### 1. **Call**
- **If win:**

### Probabilities
- **Win:** 45%

**Assumptions:**
- Pot: $500  
- Opponent all-in: $5,000  
- Your call to match: $5,000  
- Your stack: $20,000  
- Win probability: 45%  
- Lose probability: 55%  

**If you call:**  
- Total pot after call: $500 (current) + $5,000 (opponent) + $5,000 (your call) = $10,500  
- Net profit if win: +$5,500 ($10,500 won − $5,000 call)  
- Net loss if lose: −$5,000 (your call)

**Expected Value (EV):**  
EV = (Win % × Profit if Win) + (Lose % × Loss if Lose)  
= (0.45 × $5,500) + (0.55 × -$5,000)  
= $2,475 − $2,750  
= -$275

**If you fold:**  
- Net profit: $0

**Conclusion:**  
Folding is the optimal choice. Calling loses an average of $275 per hand, while folding loses nothing. The risk of losing $5,000 outweighs the potential gain, given a 45% win probability.",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr

**Assumptions:**  
- Your stack before the hand: $20,000  
- Pot: $500  
- Opponent’s all-in: $5,000 (to call, you must match $5,000)
