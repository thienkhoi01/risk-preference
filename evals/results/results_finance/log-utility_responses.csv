**Job 1:**  
- 90% chance of $50,000  
- 10% chance of $550,000 ($50,000 + $500,000)

**Job 2:**  
- 95% chance of $60,000

\( EU_1 = 0.9 \times \ln(50,000) + 0.1 \times \ln(550,000) \)  
\( EU_2 = 0.95 \times \ln(60,000) + 0.05 \times \ln(260,000) \)

- \( \ln(50,000) \approx 10.8198 \)
- \( \ln(550,000) \approx 13.2206 \)
- \( \ln(60,000) \approx 11.0021 \)

- Success: $1,000,000
- Failure: $1,000,000
- $EU(0) = \ln(1,000,000) = 13.8155$

- Ownership: 100%
- Success: $1,000,000 - $100,000 + $50,000,000 = $50,900,000$

### 3. Partial investment ($x = $10,000):
- Ownership: 10%
- Success: $1,000,000 - $10,000 + $5,000,000 = $5,990,000$

- $EU(30,000) = 0.02 \times \ln(15,970,000) + 0.98 \times \ln(970,000) = 0.02 \times 16.58 + 0.98 \times 13.78 = 0.332 + 13.504 = 13.836$

The expected utility is maximized at a $20,000 investment, which would buy 20% of the company.

3,7,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Let’s denote your initial wealth as \( W \). The investment opportunity is:

- 2% chance: final wealth = \( W - x + x \times (50M / 100K) \)
- 98% chance: final wealth = \( W - x \)

The multiple in the good case is \( 50M / 100K = 500 \).

**Expected utility:**
\[

\[
\frac{0.02 \cdot 499}{W + 499x} = \frac{0.98}{W - x}

\[
9.98(W - x) = 0.98(W + 499x)

\[
9.98W - 9.98x = 0.98W + 489.02x

**Assumptions:**  
- Wealth = $200,000  
- Insurance pays $10,000 if house burns (loss is $200,000)  
- Insurance costs $500  
- Probability of fire = 0.1% = 0.001

**Case 1: No insurance**  
- With fire: Wealth = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0  
- Without fire: Wealth = $200,000  
- Expected utility:  
  \( EU_{no\ insurance} = 0.001 \times \ln(0) + 0.999 \times \ln(200{,}000) \)

- \(\ln(0)\) is negative infinity, so expected utility is negative infinity (unacceptable outcome).

**Case 2: Buy insurance**  
- Wealth after paying premium = $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
- With fire: Insurance pays $10,000, so wealth = $199,500 + $10,000 - $200,000 = $9,500  
- Without fire: Wealth = $199,500  
- Expected utility:  
  \( EU_{insurance} = 0.001 \times \ln(9{,}500) + 0.999 \times \ln(199{,}500) \)

**Conclusion:**  
The key result is that without insurance, there is a 0.1% chance of ending up with zero wealth, which gives negative infinity utility and dominates the calculation. With insurance, the worst possible outcome is $9,500, which is far preferable.

**Optimal choice:**

**Expected utility (no insurance):**

- Final wealth in all scenarios: $200,000 − $500 = $199,500

**Expected utility (insurance):**

Buying insurance avoids the possibility of losing all wealth ($0) and results in a certain final wealth of $199,500.

**Assumptions:**  
- Initial wealth: $200,000 (house value)  
- Insurance cost: $500  
- Payout if house burns: $10,000  
- Probability of fire: 0.001 (0.1%)

**1. Buy Insurance:**  
- Pay $500 upfront.  
- If house burns down: wealth = $200,000 - $500 (insurance cost) = $199,500 (insurance pays $10,000, but house is $200,000, so net loss is $200,000 - $10,000). This interpretation is key: insurance covers only $10,000, not full house value.
- If no fire: wealth = $200,000 - $500 = $199,500

Outcomes:
- 0.1% chance: $199,500 (after payout)
- 99.9% chance: $199,500

Expected wealth: $199,500 (since both cases yield same amount)

**2. Don’t Buy Insurance:**  
- If house burns down: wealth = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0  
- If no fire: wealth = $200,000

Outcomes:
- 0.1% chance: $0
- 99.9% chance: $200,000

Expected utility:

ln(0) is negative infinity, so expected utility is extremely low (essentially negative infinity) due to risk of losing everything.

EV = $11,475 + $8,250 = $19,725

**Conclusion:**  
Calling has a higher EV ($19,725) than folding ($19,500). It is optimal to call the all-in with pocket tens given these odds.",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr
10,10,"You're playing poker and have pocket tens (the fifth best starting hand). The pot is $500, and your opponent goes all-in for $5,000. You estimate you have a 45% chance of winning. You have $20,000 in chips. Should you call?","Let’s define the options:

- **Call:** Risk $5,000 to win $5,500 (pot + call).  
- **Fold:** Keep $20,000.

**Outcomes if call:**
- Win (45%): $20,000 + $500 (pot) + $5,000 (opponent’s bet) = $25,500
- Lose (55%): $20,000 – $5,000 = $15,000

**Expected utility (using ln as utility function):**
- EV = 0.45 × ln(25,500) + 0.55 × ln(15,000)
- ln(25,500) ≈ 10.15
- ln(15,000) ≈ 9.62
- EV_call ≈ 0.45 × 10.15 + 0.55 × 9.62 ≈ 4.57 + 5.29 = 9.86

**Fold:**
- ln(20,000) ≈ 9.90

**Comparison:**  
- Call: 9.86  
- Fold: 9.90

**Decision:**  
Folding is optimal. The expected value of calling is lower than folding given these numbers. The risk of losing $5,000 outweighs the potential gain, based on the 45% win probability and current bankroll.",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr
