log-utility,1.0,1,You have $1000. You have an option to put on any amount of money on a 51/49 coin flip. How much are you investing?,"Let \( W = \$1000 \). Bet \( x \) on a coin flip with 51% chance to double the stake, 49% chance to lose the stake.

Expected utility:  
\[
E[U] = 0.51 \ln(1000 + x) + 0.49 \ln(1000 - x)
\]

Maximize with respect to \( x \):

Set derivative to zero:
\[
0.51 \left( \frac{1}{1000 + x} \right) - 0.49 \left( \frac{1}{1000 - x} \right) = 0
\]
\[
0.51(1000 - x) = 0.49(1000 + x)
\]
\[
510 - 0.51x = 490 + 0.49x
\]
\[
20 = 1x
\]
\[
x = 20
\]

**Optimal investment:** Bet $20 on the coin flip.  
**Reason:** With $1000 and CRRA log utility, the optimal bet size balances the higher chance of winning (51%) and the risk of losing, leading to a bet of 2% of total wealth.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,2,"There are 2 securities, securities A which has an expected return of 5% with a vol of 20%, securities B which has an expected return of 3% and a vol of 15%. The correlation between the 2 securities is 0.5. You have a cap on investment of $1M gross, how much do you invest in each securities?","Given:  
- Security A: Expected return = 5%, Volatility = 20%  
- Security B: Expected return = 3%, Volatility = 15%  
- Correlation (A, B) = 0.5  
- Maximum gross investment = $1,000,000  
- Log utility (CRRA 1)

Assume starting wealth = $1,000,000 (to make dollar results meaningful).

Let \( x \) = proportion invested in A  
Let \( y \) = proportion invested in B  
Constraint: \( |x| + |y| \leq 1 \) (no leveraging beyond 100% of wealth)

### Key Calculations

#### Mean and variance of portfolio
Let
- \( \mu_A = 5\% \), \( \sigma_A = 20\% \)  
- \( \mu_B = 3\% \), \( \sigma_B = 15\% \)  
- \( \rho = 0.5 \)

Portfolio mean:  
\( E[r_p] = x\mu_A + y\mu_B \)

Variance:  
\( \sigma_p^2 = x^2\sigma_A^2 + y^2\sigma_B^2 + 2xy\rho\sigma_A\sigma_B \)

#### For log utility, the objective is approximately maximizing  
\( E[r_p] - \frac{1}{2}\sigma_p^2 \)

So,  
Objective:  
\( x\mu_A + y\mu_B - \frac{1}{2}(x^2\sigma_A^2 + y^2\sigma_B^2 + 2xy\rho\sigma_A\sigma_B) \)

Plug in numbers:  
\( x \cdot 0.05 + y \cdot 0.03 - \frac{1}{2} \left[ x^2 \cdot 0.04 + y^2 \cdot 0.0225 + 2xy \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 0.15 \right] \)  
\( = x \cdot 0.05 + y \cdot 0.03 - \frac{1}{2} (0.04x^2 + 0.0225y^2 + 0.03xy) \)

Simplifies to:  
\( 0.05x + 0.03y - 0.02x^2 - 0.01125y^2 - 0.015xy \)

#### Under the budget constraint \( x + y = 1 \), \( x,y \geq 0 \)
Solve for optimal allocation:

Let \( y = 1 - x \):

Plug in to objective:  
\( 0.05x + 0.03(1-x) - 0.02x^2 - 0.01125(1-x)^2 - 0.015x(1-x) \)

Expand and simplify:

\( = 0.05x + 0.03 - 0.03x - 0.02x^2 - 0.01125(1 - 2x + x^2) - 0.015x + 0.015x^2 \)

\( = 0.05x + 0.03 - 0.03x - 0.02x^2 - 0.01125 + 0.0225x - 0.01125x^2 - 0.015x + 0.015x^2 \)

Collect like terms:

- Constants: \( 0.03 - 0.01125 = 0.01875 \)
- x terms: \( 0.05x - 0.03x + 0.0225x - 0.015x = 0.0275x \)
- \( x^2 \) terms: \( -0.02x^2 - 0.01125x^2 + 0.015x^2 = -0.01625x^2 \)

So,

\( 0.01875 + 0.0275x - 0.01625x^2 \)

Maximize in \( x \) between 0 and 1.

The optimum is at:
\( x^* = \frac{0.0275}{2 \cdot 0.01625} = \frac{0.0275}{0.0325} \approx 0.846 \)

Since this is between 0 and 1, this is feasible.

So,

- Invest \( x^* \approx 84.6\% \) in Security A: $846,000  
- Invest \( 1 - x^* \approx 15.4\% \) in Security B: $154,000

### Conclusion

Invest \$846,000 in Security A (expected return 5%, volatility 20%) and \$154,000 in Security B (expected return 3%, volatility 15%). The higher allocation to A is driven by its higher expected return relative to risk, as well as the diversification benefit from the correlation.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,3,"There are 2 securities, A and B, where A has a expected return of 5% and a vol of 100%, securities B which has a expected return of 1% and a vol of 1%. The 2 securities are uncorrelated. You have a total portfolio vol limit of 1M. How much should you invest in each securities?","Let \( x_A \) = fraction of wealth in A, \( x_B \) = fraction in B.

Given:
- \( \mu_A = 5\% \), \( \sigma_A = 100\% \)
- \( \mu_B = 1\% \), \( \sigma_B = 1\% \)
- Volatility constraint: portfolio standard deviation ≤ \( 1 \) (since $1M/$1M = fraction = 1)

Portfolio variance:  
\[
\sigma_p^2 = (x_A \sigma_A)^2 + (x_B \sigma_B)^2
\]
Since uncorrelated, no covariance term.

Constraint:  
\[
\sqrt{(x_A \cdot 1)^2 + (x_B \cdot 0.01)^2} \leq 1
\]

For log utility (coefficient 1), classic result:  
Optimal \( x_i = \frac{\mu_i - r_f}{\gamma \sigma_i^2} \) (if no risk-free, just maximize given constraint)

Full budget: \( x_A + x_B = 1 \)

But with log utility, maximize:  
\[
E[\ln(W_{\text{final}})] \approx \ln(W_0) + x_A \cdot \mu_A + x_B \cdot \mu_B - \frac{1}{2} (x_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + x_B^2 \sigma_B^2)
\]

Use Lagrange multipliers (subject to volatility constraint):
Let \( x_B \) absorb all low-risk allocation up to vol limit.

Try:
If invest entirely in B (\( x_A = 0, x_B = 1 \)),  
Portfolio vol = \( 1 \times 1\% = 1\% \ll 100\% \)—well within constraint.

If invest all in A (\( x_A = 1, x_B = 0 \)),  
Portfolio vol = \( 1 \times 100\% = 100\% \gg 1\% \)—exceeds constraint.

Let’s allocate as much as possible to A under the volatility cap. So set:
\[
\sqrt{(x_A \cdot 1)^2 + (x_B \cdot 0.01)^2} = 1
\]
But unless \( x_A \) is essentially 1, \( x_B \) contributes negligibly to vol.

So,
\[
x_A^2 \times 1^2 = 1 \implies x_A = 1
\]
That is, even 100% in A is at the limit.

Check: portfolio volatility = 100% of $1M = $1M (meets the max)

Expected dollar value in A: expected return is 5%, so $1M × 5% = $50,000 expected gain

In contrast, all in B ($1M): Expected return is 1%, so $10,000 expected gain. But risk is tiny, so with log utility, risk dominates only as risk gets very high compared to expected return.

The optimal allocation is:

- $1,000,000 in Security A
- $0 in Security B

Security A is used to its maximum allowed under the volatility constraint. Even 1% of wealth in Security B adds negligible return, given the volatility cap. The much higher expected return for A drives the decision.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1). I calculate expected utility to make optimal decisions.

log-utility,1.0,4,"There is an option to buy insurance on your own house. There is a 5% chance per year this insurance will pay out - where you will receive 1M in the case the house get wipe out. Otherwise, you pay 100K per  year in premium. You do feel a large amount of disutility when your house get destroy however, both emotionally, and because the house is 100% of your net worth. Should you get this insurance?","Assume current wealth (house value) is $1,000,000.

**Without insurance:**  
- 95%: Wealth remains $1,000,000.  
- 5%: Wealth becomes $0 (house destroyed).

**With insurance:**  
- Pay premium: Wealth is $1,000,000 - $100,000 = $900,000 (regardless of what happens to the house, since payout just replaces the house value).

Calculate expected utility in both cases (only key steps):

**Without insurance:**  
Expected value:  
0.95 × ln($1,000,000) + 0.05 × ln($0)  
ln($0) is -∞, so expected value is dominated by the catastrophic loss.

**With insurance:**  
Always left with $900,000, so:  
ln($900,000)

**Comparison:**  
- With insurance: ln($900,000)  
- Without insurance: ln($1,000,000) × 0.95 + (catastrophic loss, -∞, for 5%)  

The uninsured option implies a near-infinite negative outcome if the catastrophe occurs, even with just a 5% chance. The insured option avoids the catastrophic loss, only costing 10% of wealth for certainty.

**Conclusion:**  
Buy the insurance. The risk of ending at $0, even at a 5% chance, far outweighs the $100,000 annual premium. This approach maximizes outcomes given all wealth is in the house and losses are permanent.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1). I calculate expected utility to make optimal decisions.

log-utility,1.0,7,"You are offered the following sport bet: to buy, at 20% (4:1 odds) that Manchester United will win the game against Manchester City. You think the true probability is around 25%. You have $100K of savings. How much should you bet on this game?","Given:
- Odds: 4:1 (Buy at 20%)
- True probability: 25%
- Wealth: $100,000

Define bet size as \( x \).

If Man United loses (probability 0.75): wealth = $100,000 - x

Maximize:
\[

A negative value means the optimal position is to bet the *other side* (i.e., take the lay/bet against the offer at these odds), not to bet for Man United at these odds.

**Conclusion:**  
At 4:1 odds with a 25% win probability, no positive amount should be wagered on Manchester United.

log-utility,1.0,10,"A friend at university, Sam, thinks that Ben can run 5KM in 20', given a week of training. You know Ben, who is quite unfit, and you know that this is a difficult thing to do because it take you quite a while to learn this. He offers you to buy this contract at 50% odd (where you sell), in up to $10K if you want. Your net worth is only 20K, however. What should you do? ","Let’s define:

- Probability that Ben succeeds, \( p \)  
- Bet: Sell a $10,000 contract to Sam at 50% odds  
- If Ben wins: pay Sam $10,000  
- If Ben loses: keep $10,000  
- Possible wealth: $30,000 (Ben loses) or $10,000 (Ben wins)  
- Current wealth: $20,000

Assume, based on your knowledge, Ben has only a 10% chance (\( p = 0.1 \)) of succeeding.

**Expected utility:**
\[
EU = p \ln(10{,}000) + (1-p) \ln(30{,}000)

- \(\ln(30{,}000) \approx 10.31\)

\[
EU = 0.1 \times 9.210 + 0.9 \times 10.31 = 0.921 + 9.279 = 10.20
\]
Current utility (no bet):  
\(\ln(20{,}000) \approx 9.90\)

**Conclusion:**  
Selling Sam the maximum $10,000 contract increases final dollar amounts from $20,000 to either $30,000 or $10,000. With a low chance (10%) of Ben succeeding, the expectation favors taking the full $10,000 bet. The key driver is the very low likelihood of losing the $10,000 relative to the doubling in case of a win, compared to the current wealth level.

log-utility,1.0,13,"You're offered a lottery ticket for $1 that has a 1 in 10,000 chance of winning $5,000. You have $100 in cash. How many tickets should you buy?","Let \( W \) be current wealth: $100.

Let \( x \) be the number of tickets bought (\( 0 \leq x \leq 100 \)), each costing $1.

If one of your tickets wins, you receive $5,000 (plus whatever is left from $100 minus tickets bought). Since the odds are so small, assume negligible chance of multiple wins (buying 100 tickets in 10,000 possible).

The probability that at least one of \( x \) tickets wins is approximately:
\[
P(\text{win}) \approx 1 - (1 - \frac{1}{10{,}000})^{x} \approx \frac{x}{10{,}000}
\]
for small \( x \).

Wealth after buying \( x \) tickets and winning: \( 100 - x + 5{,}000 \).

Wealth if no win: \( 100 - x \).

Expected utility:
\[
EU(x) = P(\text{win}) \cdot \ln(100 - x + 5{,}000}) + (1 - P(\text{win})) \cdot \ln(100 - x)
\]
\[
= \frac{x}{10{,}000} \ln(5{,}100 - x) + \left(1 - \frac{x}{10{,}000}\right)\ln(100 - x)
\]

Find \( x \) that maximizes \( EU(x) \).

Check marginal benefit for one ticket:
\[
EU(1) \approx \frac{1}{10{,}000} \ln(5{,}099) + \frac{9{,}999}{10{,}000} \ln(99)
\]
\[
= 0.0001 \times 8.533 + 0.9999 \times 4.595
\]
\[
= 0.000853 + 4.5945 = 4.5954
\]

Compare to not buying:
\[
EU(0) = \ln(100) = 4.6052
\]

So, one ticket: 4.5954 < 4.6052. Utility decreases with even one ticket.

Test higher \( x \) (e.g., 10 tickets):

\[
EU(10) \approx \frac{10}{10{,}000} \ln(5{,}090) + \frac{9,990}{10{,}000} \ln(90)
\]
\[
= 0.001 \times 8.532 + 0.999 \times 4.5
\]
\[
= 0.008532 + 4.4955 \approx 4.504
\]

Still lower than not buying.

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal number of tickets to buy is 0.

- If lose (15%): Final wealth = $5,000 - $1,000 = $4,000

**Expected utility of calling:**  
E[ln(W)] = 0.85 × ln(5,100) + 0.15 × ln(4,000)

**Utility of folding:**  
ln(5,000) = 8.5172

**Comparison:**  
- Calling: 8.4997  
- Folding: 8.5172

Folding gives slightly higher expected utility.

**Optimal choice:**

This job is optimal—expected outcomes are driven by the 5% possibility of receiving $1,030,000, which raises expected value above the base salary alone. The chance at a high payout outweighs the low base salary for this utility function. Take the startup job.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,17,"You can invest in a cryptocurrency that has a 1% chance of going to $1,000 per coin and a 99% chance of going to $0. Current price is $1 per coin. You have $10,000 to invest. How much should you invest?","Let **x** be the amount to invest (out of $10,000).

- With 99% chance: investment goes to $0, final wealth $10,000 – $x$.
- With 1% chance: investment becomes 1,000× per $1, so $x$ → $1,000x$, final wealth $10,000 – $x$ + $1,000x$ = $10,000 + 999x$.

**Expected utility:**
\[ EU(x) = 0.99 \cdot \ln(10,000 - x) + 0.01 \cdot \ln(10,000 + 999x) \]

Differentiate w.r.t. $x$, set derivative zero:
\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = 0.99 \cdot \frac{-1}{10,000 - x} + 0.01 \cdot \frac{999}{10,000 + 999x} = 0
\]

\[
-0.99/(10,000-x) + 9.99/(10,000 + 999x) = 0
\]

\[
0.99/(10,000-x) = 9.99/(10,000 + 999x)
\]

\[
0.99(10,000 + 999x) = 9.99(10,000 - x)
\]

\[
9,900 + 989.01x = 99,900 - 9.99x

\[
989.01x + 9.99x = 99,900 - 9,900

\[
999x = 90,000

**Conclusion:**  
Invest approximately **$90** in the cryptocurrency. This balances the large potential gain with the high probability of loss, given current wealth.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,18,"You're offered insurance on your $500,000 house. There's a 0.1% chance per year of total loss, and the premium is $2,000 per year. The insurance company's expected payout is $500 per year, but they charge $2,000. Should you buy this insurance?","Let's compare expected values with and without insurance.

**Parameters:**
- Wealth = $500,000  
- Probability of loss = 0.1% = 0.001  
- Loss size = $500,000  
- Insurance premium = $2,000  
- Insurance covers full loss

---

### 1. **Without insurance:**
- With probability 0.999: final wealth = $500,000  
- With probability 0.001: final wealth = $0

Expected utility:  
\( EU = 0.999 \cdot \ln(500,000) + 0.001 \cdot \ln(0) \)
- ln(0) = -∞, so expected utility is strongly negatively impacted by even a tiny chance of zero wealth.

---

### 2. **With insurance:**
- Always pay $2,000; always keep $498,000 regardless of loss

Expected utility:  
\( EU = \ln(498,000) \)

---

### 3. **Comparison:**
The possibility of $0 wealth results in an extremely low expected utility due to the logarithmic utility function (strong risk aversion to ruin). Paying $2,000 eliminates any chance of catastrophic loss, leaving $498,000 guaranteed.

**Optimal choice:**  
Buy the insurance. Avoiding any chance of losing everything far outweighs the $2,000 cost, given the risk aversion in the log utility function. The key factor is the extreme penalty for risking total wealth loss, not the expected payout versus premium.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

- Wealth \( W = \$20,000 \)
- Probability of winning \( p = 0.06 \)
- Odds: 20:1 (bet $x$, receive $20x$ profit plus your bet if you win; total received if win = $21x$)
- Bet size = $x$

**Expected utility maximization (log utility):**

Calculate for betting $x$:
- If win: wealth = $20,000 + 20x$
- If lose: wealth = $20,000 - x$

Maximize expected log wealth:
\[
\max_x \; 0.06 \cdot \ln(20,000 + 20x) + 0.94 \cdot \ln(20,000 - x)
\]

**Set the derivative to zero:**
\[
\dfrac{d}{dx} [0.06 \ln(20,000 + 20x) + 0.94 \ln(20,000 - x)] = 0
\]

\[
0.06 \cdot \frac{20}{20,000 + 20x} - 0.94 \cdot \frac{1}{20,000 - x} = 0
\]

\[
\frac{1.2}{20,000 + 20x} = \frac{0.94}{20,000 - x}
\]

Cross-multiply:
\[
1.2 (20,000 - x) = 0.94 (20,000 + 20x)
\]

\[
24,000 - 1.2x = 18,800 + 18.8x

\[
24,000 - 18,800 = 18.8x + 1.2x
\]
\[
5,200 = 20x
\]
\[
x = 260

**Conclusion:**

The optimal bet is **$260** (1.3% of total wealth).

Set expected utility of bidding \( x \) equal to not bidding (wealth $200,000):

\[
EU(x) = \ln(200,000)
\]

Numerical search for \( x \):

Let’s try several values:

### At \( x = \$50,000 \):

- Outcomes:
  - 1M: $200,000 - $50,000 + $1,000,000 = $1,150,000$

  - 100K: $190,000$
  - 10K: $100,000$

\(

\ln(217,000) = 12.2868\\
\ln(127,000) = 11.7551\\

$85K gave 12.197, $83K is 12.214, so the cut point is just below $85K.

## **Conclusion**

The maximum bid is about **$84,000** (rounded to nearest $1,000).

At a bid of $84,000, the expected wealth gain from the auction balances the risk. This is the largest amount where the favorable outcomes (including the 15% chance of a $1M value) offset the risk of overpaying based on your wealth and risk preference.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

You think there's a 12% chance of this happening. The derivative costs $50. You have $5,000. How many should you buy?","Let \( x \) be the number of contracts to buy.

**Possible outcomes:**
- Rain (>2 in): With probability 0.12, wealth = \( 5,000 - 50x + 1,000x = 5,000 + 950x \)
- No rain: With probability 0.88, wealth = \( 5,000 - 50x \)

**Expected utility:**
\[
\mathbb{E}[U] = 0.12 \cdot \ln(5,000 + 950x) + 0.88 \cdot \ln(5,000 - 50x)
\]

Maximize with respect to \( x \):

**Derivative with respect to \( x \):**
\[
\frac{d\,\mathbb{E}[U]}{dx} = 0.12 \cdot \frac{950}{5,000 + 950x} - 0.88 \cdot \frac{50}{5,000 - 50x}

\]

\[

**Check affordability:**
- Cost to buy 7 contracts: $350
- Final wealth if no rain: $5,000 - $350 = $4,650 (positive)
- Final wealth if rain: $5,000 - $350 + $7,000 = $11,650

**Integer number:**  
Buy **7 contracts**.  

**Conclusion:**  
Optimal choice is to buy 7 weather derivatives for a total cost of $350. With this, if it rains, the gain is significant, while if not, the loss is manageable given the starting wealth. The optimal purchase balances the relatively low probability of a payout with the large potential return and small cost per contract.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

- Insurance premium: $2,000 per year

How much should you invest?","With $50,000 and a logarithmic utility function (CRRA with coefficient 1: \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)), maximizing expected utility means making decisions based on expected real wealth.

- Bond pays 2% interest, but real return could be negative due to uncertain inflation.
- If the real return is 0% or negative, holding cash or investing in the bond yields similar or worse final wealth in real terms.

Key calculation:
- Invest all $50,000 in the bond: if real return = 2%, final wealth = $51,000.
- If real return < 0% (e.g., inflation > 2%), real purchasing power decreases.
- Holding cash yields 0% nominal, so also eroded by inflation at the same rate.

With log utility, any strictly positive expected return is optimal to take, even if small, as long as there is no risk of loss above the riskless alternative (here, cash is equally exposed to inflation).

**Optimal choice:**  
Invest 100% ($50,000) in the bond.  
With no default risk and a positive nominal return, the bond is preferred, since inflation risk affects both the bond and cash similarly.

The contract costs $400K to fulfill. You're worried about your reputation if you fail to deliver. You have $1M available. Should you take this contract?","Let initial wealth \( W_0 = \$1,000,000 \).  
Cost of contract = \$400,000 (paid up front).  
Net wealth outcomes after contract:

- **20%:** Get paid \$2,000,000. Final wealth = \(1,000,000 - 400,000 + 2,000,000 = \$2,600,000 \)
- **30%:** Get paid \$500,000. Final wealth = \(1,000,000 - 400,000 + 500,000 = \$1,100,000 \)
- **50%:** Get paid \$0. Final wealth = \(1,000,000 - 400,000 + 0 = \$600,000 \)

Expected utility if contract taken:

**Conclusion:**  
Paying \$150 for insurance leaves \$19,850, which leads to a higher expected outcome (by these calculations) than risking a \$2,000 loss with a 5% chance. Therefore, purchasing the insurance is optimal since the small risk reduction is worth the cost given the logarithmic utility from wealth.

log-utility,1.0,56,"You're at a casino and see a blackjack table where you can count cards. You estimate you have a 1% edge over the house. You have $25,000 in your pocket. How much should you bet per hand?","Given a CRRA utility function \( U(W) = \ln(W) \) and a 1% edge (advantage) per hand, the optimal bet is given by the Kelly criterion:

\[

where  
- \( p \) = probability of winning  
- \( q = 1 - p \) = probability of losing  
- \( b \) = odds received on the bet (for even money, \( b = 1 \))

Given a 1% edge:  
Let \( p = 0.505 \) (since typical blackjack has \( p \approx 0.495 \), but here, player's edge is 1%).  
So, \( p = 0.505 \), \( q = 0.495 \), \( b = 1 \):

\[
f^* = \frac{0.505 \cdot 1 - 0.495}{1} = 0.01

Thus, bet 1% of current wealth per hand.

With $25,000 on hand:

\[

- Probability of sun (lose $200): 60%  
- Probability of clouds (win $250): 40%

Calculate expected utility of both options:

**1. Do not take the bet:**  
Wealth = $10,000

**2. Take the bet:**  
- Sun (60%): $10,000 - $200 = $9,800  
- Cloud (40%): $10,000 + $250 = $10,250  

Expected utility:

- 0.05% of $50B = 0.0005 × $50,000,000,000 = $250,000
- 0.05% of $5B = 0.0005 × $5,000,000,000 = $25,000
- 0.05% of $0 = $0

Probabilities:
- $250,000 with 2% 
- $25,000 with 8%
- $0 with 90%

Expected equity value:
= (2% × $250,000) + (8% × $25,000) + (90% × $0)

Assume all equity vests and is liquid at exit.  
Total expected cash next year: $60,000 (salary) + $7,000 (expected equity) = $67,000

Assume current wealth = $0 for simplicity (since absolute levels don't affect choice with log utility over just one year’s income).

Expected log-wealth:

**Outcomes after fulfilling the contract:**
- Win $5M: Net = $1.5M (current) - $300K (cost) + $5M = $6.2M (probability 15%)
- Win $500K: Net = $1.5M - $300K + $500K = $1.7M (probability 35%)
- Win $0: Net = $1.5M - $300K = $1.2M (probability 50%)

**Expected utility (using ln for CRRA 1):**
\[
EU = 0.15 \cdot \ln(6.2\,\text{M}) + 0.35 \cdot \ln(1.7\,\text{M}) + 0.5 \cdot \ln(1.2\,\text{M})

Calculating:
- \(\ln(6,200,000) \approx 15.64\)
- \(\ln(1,700,000) \approx 14.35\)
- \(\ln(1,200,000) \approx 13.99\)

So:

**Final wealth scenarios:**  
- Success: \( W_{success} = \$50,000 - x + x \times \frac{5{,}000}{2} = \$50,000 - x + 2,500x = \$50,000 + 2,499x \)

Equity share = 0.02% = 0.0002

- If company worth $200B:  $200,000,000,000 × 0.0002 = $400,000
- If company worth $20B:  $20,000,000,000 × 0.0002 = $40,000
- If company worth $0:  $0 × 0.0002 = $0

**Step 2: Calculate total potential payouts**

- $200B outcome: $80,000 + $400,000 = $480,000 (probability 0.5%)
- $20B outcome: $80,000 + $40,000 = $120,000 (probability 2%)
- $0 outcome: $80,000 + $0 = $80,000 (probability 97.5%)

**Step 3: Expected (log) utility calculation**

\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.005 \times \ln(480{,}000) + 0.02 \times \ln(120{,}000) + 0.975 \times \ln(80{,}000)
\]

- $\ln(480,000) \approx 13.08$
- $\ln(120,000) \approx 11.70$
- $\ln(80,000) \approx 11.29$

\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.005 \times 13.08 + 0.02 \times 11.70 + 0.975 \times 11.29
\]
\[

**Step 4: Certainty equivalent calculation**

\[
\text{Certainty Equivalent} = e^{E[\ln(W)]} \approx e^{11.307} \approx \$81,646

Assuming the alternative is a different job with a straightforward $80,000 salary (and no equity):

Taking the job yields an effective value of about $81,600, which is only about 2% more than the guaranteed $80,000.

This would imply investing nearly all wealth, but let's check proximity to wealth:

If $1,959,800 is invested, leftover cash is $2,000,000 - $1,959,800 = $40,200. In case of default, would be left with $40,200.

In reality, with high risk aversion and logarithmic utility, typical optimal solution is to invest a small fraction when default is possible, but due to the extremely tiny default probability and relatively high return, the optimal investment is extremely close to the full amount.

**Optimal choice:**  
Invest approximately $1,959,800 in the bond. The very low default probability (0.01%) and the positive 0.5% interest make it optimal to invest nearly all available wealth, keeping a small cash reserve.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,72,You can invest in a company that has a 0.001% chance of being worth $500M and a 99.999% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $8M. The company is working on climate change solutions. How much should you invest?,"Given:  
- Probability company succeeds: 0.001% = 0.00001  
- Success payoff: $500,000,000  
- Failure payoff: $0  
- Current company value: $8,000,000  

Let initial wealth \( W_0 \) be $8,000,000 to match the investment context. Let \( x \) be the fraction of wealth to invest (amount invested is \( x W_0 \)). If the investment succeeds:  
- Total wealth: \( W_0 - x W_0 + x W_0 \cdot \frac{500,000,000}{8,000,000} = W_0 (1 - x + x \cdot 62.5) = W_0 (1 + 61.5x) \)  
If the investment fails:  
- Total wealth: \( W_0 - x W_0 = W_0 (1 - x) \)  

Expected utility (with \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)):  
\[
E[U] = 0.00001 \cdot \ln(W_0 (1 + 61.5x)) + 0.99999 \cdot \ln(W_0 (1 - x))
\]

Since \( \ln(W_0) \) is constant, omit it for maximization:  
\[
E[U] = 0.00001 \ln(1 + 61.5x) + 0.99999 \ln(1 - x)
\]

Maximize with respect to \( x \):

Take derivative and set to zero:  
\[
\frac{dE[U]}{dx} = 0.00001 \frac{61.5}{1 + 61.5x} - 0.99999 \frac{1}{1 - x} = 0
\]
\[
0.000615/(1 + 61.5x) = 0.99999/(1 - x)
\]
\[
0.000615 (1 - x) = 0.99999 (1 + 61.5x)
\]
\[
0.000615 - 0.000615x = 0.99999 + 61.499385x
\]
\[
-0.000615x - 61.499385x = 0.99999 - 0.000615
\]
\[
-61.5000x = 0.999375
\]
\[
x = -0.01624
\]

A negative \( x \) means the optimal choice is to **not invest** (i.e., invest $0).  

**Conclusion**:  
Do not invest in the company. The extremely low probability of success relative to the price means the optimal amount to invest is $0.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,73,"You're offered a bet where you can wager any amount on a coin flip. If heads, you win 0.9x your bet. If tails, you lose your bet. You have $12,000 available. You're feeling very lucky today. How much should you bet?","Let bet amount = \( x \), wealth = \( W = \$12,000 \).

- Win (probability 0.5): Wealth = \( 12,000 + 0.9x \)
- Lose (probability 0.5): Wealth = \( 12,000 - x \)

Expected utility:
\[
EU = 0.5 \cdot \ln(12,000 + 0.9x) + 0.5 \cdot \ln(12,000 - x)
\]

Maximize \( EU \) with respect to \( x \):

First-order condition:
\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = 0.5 \cdot \frac{0.9}{12,000 + 0.9x} - 0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{12,000 - x} = 0
\]
\[
\frac{0.9}{12,000 + 0.9x} = \frac{1}{12,000 - x}
\]
\[
0.9(12,000 - x) = 12,000 + 0.9x
\]
\[
10,800 - 0.9x = 12,000 + 0.9x
\]
\[
10,800 - 12,000 = 0.9x + 0.9x \rightarrow -1,200 = 1.8x
\]
\[
x = -\frac{1,200}{1.8} = -666.67
\]

A negative bet is not possible. So, the optimal amount to bet is $0.

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal choice is to bet $0 out of $12,000. The edge is not favorable: the maximum possible expected gain (0.9x on heads, lose x on tails) is negative, so no bet should be placed.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,74,"A company offers you a contract to supply goods. There's a 5% chance they'll pay you $20M, a 15% chance they'll pay you $2M, and a 80% chance they'll pay you nothing. The contract costs $800K to fulfill. You're worried about your family's financial security. You have $3M available. Should you take this contract?","Let current wealth \( W = \$3{,}000{,}000 \).

**Contract payouts and net final wealth:**

1. **$20M Payment:**  
   Final wealth: \( 3,000,000 - 800,000 + 20,000,000 = \$22,200,000 \) (5% chance)

2. **$2M Payment:**  
   Final wealth: \( 3,000,000 - 800,000 + 2,000,000 = \$4,200,000 \) (15% chance)

3. **No payment:**  
   Final wealth: \( 3,000,000 - 800,000 = \$2,200,000 \) (80% chance)

**Expected utility if taking contract:**
\[
EU_{\text{contract}} = 0.05 \cdot \ln(22,200,000) + 0.15 \cdot \ln(4,200,000) + 0.80 \cdot \ln(2,200,000)
\]
\[
= 0.05 \cdot 16.920 + 0.15 \cdot 15.255 + 0.80 \cdot 14.603

**Comparison:**
- \( EU_{\text{contract}} = 14.817 \)
- \( EU_{\text{no contract}} = 14.914 \)

**Conclusion:**  
Do not take the contract.

log-utility,1.0,75,"You're offered a lottery ticket for $5 that has a 1 in 500,000 chance of winning $2,000,000. The expected value is negative. You're feeling very lucky and it's Friday the 13th. You have $200. How many tickets should you buy?","Let’s calculate:

- Initial wealth: \( W = \$200 \)
- Ticket cost: \( C = \$5 \)
- Tickets to buy: \( n \) (must be integer, \( n \leq 40 \) since \( 5n \leq 200 \))
- Probability of win per ticket: \( p = \frac{1}{500,\!000} \)
- Prize: \( P = \$2,\!000,\!000 \)

For \( n \) tickets:
- No tickets: wealth \( = 200 \) 
- Buy \( n \) tickets: wealth if no win \( = 200 - 5n \)
- Probability of at least one win: \( 1 - (1 - p)^n \)
- Wealth if win: \( 200 - 5n + 2,\!000,\!000 \approx 2,\!000,\!200 - 5n \)

For \( n \) tickets, expected utility:
\[
EU(n) = (1-p)^n \cdot \ln(200-5n) + [1 - (1-p)^n] \cdot \ln(2,000,200-5n)
\]

Only integer \( n \) with \( 0 \leq n \leq 40 \), and \( 200-5n > 0 \).

Now, trying key values:

**n = 0:**
\[
EU(0) = \ln(200) \approx 5.30
\]

**n = 1:**
\[
(1-p)^1 = 0.999998
\]
\[
EU(1) = 0.999998 \cdot \ln(195) + (1-0.999998) \cdot \ln(2,000,195) 
\]
\[
= 0.999998 \cdot 5.273 + 0.000002 \cdot 14.508 
\]
\[
\approx 5.273 + 0.000029 \approx 5.273
\]

**n = 2:**
\[
(1-p)^2 \approx 0.999996
\]
\[
EU(2) = 0.999996 \cdot \ln(190) + 0.000004 \cdot \ln(2,000,190) 
\]
\[
= 0.999996 \cdot 5.247 + 0.000004 \cdot 14.508 
\]
\[
\approx 5.247 + 0.000058 \approx 5.247
\]

**n = 3:**
\[
(1-p)^3 \approx 0.999994
\]
\[
EU(3) = 0.999994 \cdot \ln(185) + 0.000006 \cdot \ln(2,000,185) 
\]
\[
= 0.999994 \cdot 5.220 + 0.000006 \cdot 14.508 
\]
\[
\approx 5.220 + 0.000087 \approx 5.220
\]

Comparing all, the expected utility drops as the number of tickets increases.

**Bottom line:**  
Buying 0 tickets gives the highest expected outcome for logarithmic (CRRA 1) utility and $200 wealth.  
**Buy 0 tickets.** The small chance of a large win does not compensate for the substantial immediate reduction in wealth from buying tickets at $5 each; this is clear from the logarithmic calculation.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

Let \( x \) be the amount invested in the bond, and \( 75,000 - x \) held in cash (assume 0% return for cash, and ignore inflation since only the bond is at risk).

Outcomes:
- 99% chance: Wealth = cash + bond with interest = \( 75,000 - x + 1.04x = 75,000 + 0.04x \)
- 1% chance: Bond defaults, wealth = cash = \( 75,000 - x \)

Expected utility:

Conclusion:
The expected wealth from taking the bet is slightly higher than not taking the bet ($49,970 vs. $50,000 in expectation, but these amounts are close).

\]

\[
-\frac{0.01996}{W_0 - 0.02x} + \frac{0.99996}{W_0 + 499.98x} = 0
\]
\[
\frac{0.99996}{W_0 + 499.98x} = \frac{0.01996}{W_0 - 0.02x}

\[
0.99996 (W_0 - 0.02x) = 0.01996(W_0 + 499.98x)
\]
\[
0.99996 W_0 - 0.0199992x = 0.01996 W_0 + 9.9796008 x
\]
\[
0.99996 W_0 - 0.01996 W_0 = 9.9796008x + 0.0199992x
\]
\[
0.98000 W_0 = 9.999600x
\]
\[
x = \frac{0.98 W_0}{9.9996}
\]
For \( W_0 = 100,000 \):

\[
x = \frac{0.98 \times 100,000}{9.9996} \approx \frac{98,000}{10} = 9,800
\]

**Conclusion:**  
Buy approximately **9,800 shares**.  
Key numbers: $0.02 per share, a win results in $500 per share, with a 0.2% chance. The optimal spend is $196 for a very large possible payoff, balancing the very low probability of success.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

Parameters:
- Wealth: $150,000
- Bond interest: 1.5%
- Default probability: 0.2%
- Assume, in default, you lose all principal.

Expected final wealth if investing all $150,000:
- With probability 99.8%: $150,000 × 1.015 = $152,250
- With probability 0.2%: $0

Expected log wealth:
= 0.998 × ln($152,250) + 0.002 × ln($0)

But ln($0) = -∞, so expected utility collapses due to possibility of total loss, no matter how small. With log utility, any chance of losing everything makes the investment infinitely unattractive.

Optimal choice:

- If it rains (70%): final wealth = $10,000 - $100 = $9,900

The company has a 1% chance of being worth $100B, a 4% chance of being worth $10B, and a 95% chance of being worth $0. The job requires working 80 hours per week. Should you take this job?","**Step 1: Calculate potential equity payouts**

Equity share = 0.01% = 0.0001

- With company worth $100B:  $100,000,000,000 × 0.0001 = $10,000,000  
- With company worth $10B:    $10,000,000,000 × 0.0001 = $1,000,000  
- With company worth $0:       $0 × 0.0001 = $0

**Step 2: Calculate total payout in each scenario**

Base salary: $100,000

- Scenario 1 (1%): $100,000 + $10,000,000 = $10,100,000  
- Scenario 2 (4%): $100,000 + $1,000,000 = $1,100,000  
- Scenario 3 (95%): $100,000

**Step 3: Calculate expected utility (expected ln(wealth))**

Assume negligible prior wealth (since a constant shifts all logs equally).

\[
EU = 0.01 \times \ln(10,100,000) + 0.04 \times \ln(1,100,000) + 0.95 \times \ln(100,000)
\]

\[
\ln(10,100,000) \approx 16.129
\]
\[
\ln(1,100,000) \approx 13.914
\]
\[
\ln(100,000) \approx 11.513
\]

\[
EU = 0.01 \times 16.129 + 0.04 \times 13.914 + 0.95 \times 11.513 = 0.16129 + 0.55656 + 10.93735 = 11.6552
\]

**Step 4: Compare with alternative (e.g., a standard 40-hour job at $100,000 base only)**

With $100,000 guaranteed:
\[
\ln(100,000) \approx 11.513
\]

**Conclusion:**

Taking the job with $100,000 + 0.01% equity gives a higher expected value than simply receiving a $100,000 salary with no equity. The potential for a large equity payout, even at low probability, offsets the extra risk and effort required given these probabilities and payout sizes. The key driver is the huge possible equity windfall in rare scenarios, which outweighs the long hours from a strictly expected log-wealth standpoint.

log-utility,1.0,86,"You can bet on a horse race where you get 10:1 odds on a horse you think has a 8% chance of winning. You've been studying horse racing for years and consider yourself an expert. You have $10,000. How much should you bet?","Let's define:

- Probability of winning, \( p = 0.08 \)
- Odds: 10:1 (for every $1 bet, you win $10 if the horse wins, plus your $1 back—a total of $11)
- Initial wealth, \( W = \$10,000 \)
- Amount to bet, \( x \)

The expected utility to maximize is:
\[
E[\ln(\text{final wealth})] = p \cdot \ln(W + x \cdot 10) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(W - x)
\]

Take derivative w.r.t. \( x \):
\[
0 = p \cdot \frac{10}{W + 10x} - (1-p)\cdot \frac{1}{W - x}
\]
\[
p \cdot \frac{10}{W + 10x} = (1-p) \cdot \frac{1}{W - x}
\]

Plug in numbers:

- \( W = 10,000 \)
- \( p = 0.08 \)
- \( 1-p = 0.92 \)

\[
0.08 \cdot \frac{10}{10,000 + 10x} = 0.92 \cdot \frac{1}{10,000 - x}
\]

Multiply both sides by denominators:

\[
0.8(10,000 - x) = 0.92(10,000 + 10x)
\]
\[
8,000 - 0.8x = 9,200 + 9.2x

\[
8,000 - 9,200 = 9.2x + 0.8x

-1,200 = 10x

\[
x = -120

E[U] = 0.001 \cdot \ln\left((1 - x)W_0 + 10,000xW_0\right) + 0.999 \cdot \ln((1-x)W_0)
\]
Factoring out \(W_0\) (it's multiplicative for log utility), doesn't impact the fraction to invest:

\[
E[U] = 0.001 \cdot \ln(1 - x + 10,000x) + 0.999 \cdot \ln(1-x)
\]

Find \(x\) that maximizes \(E[U]\):

Set derivative to zero:
\[
0.001 \cdot \frac{10,000 - 1}{1 - x + 10,000x} - 0.999 \cdot \frac{1}{1-x} = 0
\]

\[
0.001 \cdot \frac{9,999}{1 - x + 10,000x} = 0.999 \cdot \frac{1}{1-x}
\]

\[
\frac{9.999}{1 - x + 10,000x} = \frac{0.999}{1-x}
\]

\[
9.999(1-x) = 0.999(1 - x + 10,000x)
\]

\[
9.999 - 9.999x = 0.999 - 0.999x + 9,990x
\]

\[
9.999 - 0.999 = 9.999x - 0.999x + 9,990x
\]
\[
9 = (9.999 - 0.999 + 9,990)x
\]
\[
9 = (9 + 9,990)x
\]
\[
9 = 9,999x
\]
\[
x = \frac{9}{9,999} \approx 0.0009
\]

So, **optimal to invest about 0.09% of total wealth**.

With $1,000,000 starting wealth, invest:
\[
\$1,000,000 \times 0.0009 = \$900
\]

**Optimal choice: Invest $900 (0.09% of total wealth) in the startup.**

log-utility,1.0,94,"A company offers you a job with a $120,000 base salary plus 0.005% equity. The company has a 0.2% chance of being worth $500B, a 1% chance of being worth $50B, and a 98.8% chance of being worth $0. You hate the company's culture. Should you take this job?","**Step 1: Calculate potential equity payouts**

Equity share = 0.005% = 0.00005

- If company worth $500B:  $500,000,000,000 × 0.00005 = $25,000,000  
- If company worth $50B:    $50,000,000,000 × 0.00005 = $2,500,000  
- If company worth $0:       $0 × 0.00005 = $0

**Step 2: Calculate expected wealth from equity**

Probabilities:  
- $25,000,000:  0.2% = 0.002  
- $2,500,000:  1% = 0.01  
- $0: 98.8% = 0.988

Assume current wealth = $0 (so wealth = salary + equity payout).

Total payout in each scenario (salary + equity):

- $25,000,000 + $120,000 = $25,120,000  
- $2,500,000 + $120,000 = $2,620,000  
- $0 + $120,000 = $120,000

**Step 3: Calculate expected utility**

U(W) = ln(W).  
Expected utility:

= 0.002 × ln(25,120,000) + 0.01 × ln(2,620,000) + 0.988 × ln(120,000)  
= 0.002 × 17.038 + 0.01 × 14.781 + 0.988 × 11.695  
= 0.0341 + 0.1478 + 11.542  
= 11.7249

**Step 4: Compare to a sure alternative**

If not taking the job, assume taking a different job at comparable salary, $120,000 (since no info about other offers).

- ln(120,000) = 11.695

**Step 5: Which gives higher utility?**

- Expected utility from this job: 11.7249  
- Utility from sure $120,000: 11.695

**Conclusion:**  
Taking the job gives a higher expected outcome than a guaranteed $120,000 salary, despite the low probability of the equity payout. The large potential upside from the equity outweighs the negatives implied by the probabilities. The deciding factor is the extremely large equity payout in rare scenarios, which raises the average outcome. **Accept the job with $120,000 base salary and 0.005% equity.**","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

**Roulette bet:**  
- Probability of win: \( p = \frac{1}{37} \)
- Probability of loss: \( 1 - p = \frac{36}{37} \)
- Win payout: Bet $x$ → receive $60x$ profit (total $W + 60x$).
- Lose: $x$ is lost (total $W - x$).

**Expected utility maximization:**  
Maximize: \( E[\ln(W')] = \frac{1}{37}\ln(W + 60x) + \frac{36}{37}\ln(W - x) \)

Set derivative with respect to $x$ to 0:

\[
\frac{60}{37} \cdot \frac{1}{W+60x} - \frac{36}{37} \cdot \frac{1}{W-x} = 0

log-utility,1.0,96,"You're offered a bond that pays 2.5% interest with a 0.05% chance of default. The expected return is positive. You're very conservative and prefer to keep money in a savings account. You have $500,000 available. How much should you invest?","Given log utility, I maximize expected ln(wealth).  
Let \( x \) be the amount to invest in the bond, \( 500,000 - x \) stays in the savings account (assume 0% interest, risk-free).

**Payoff scenarios:**
- Bond does not default (probability 0.9995): Final wealth = \( 500,000 - x + x \times 1.025 \)
- Bond defaults (probability 0.0005): Final wealth = \( 500,000 - x \) (assume total loss on bond; most conservative)

**Expected utility:**
\[
EU = 0.9995 \times \ln(500,000 - x + 1.025x) + 0.0005 \times \ln(500,000 - x)
\]
\[
= 0.9995 \times \ln(500,000 + 0.025x) + 0.0005 \times \ln(500,000 - x)
\]

**Optimize over \( x \):**
Take derivative, set to zero:
\[
0.9995 \times \frac{0.025}{500,000 + 0.025x} - 0.0005 \times \frac{1}{500,000 - x} = 0

\[
0.9995 \times 0.025 (500,000 - x) = 0.0005 (500,000 + 0.025x)

Calculate coefficients:
- \( 0.9995 \times 0.025 = 0.0249875 \)
- \( 0.0005 \times 0.025 = 0.0000125 \)

So,
\[
0.0249875 \times (500,000 - x) = 0.0005 \times 500,000 + 0.0000125x
\]
\[
0.0249875 \times 500,000 - 0.0249875x = 250 + 0.0000125x

\[
12,493.75 - 0.0249875x - 0.0000125x = 250

\[
12,493.75 - 250 = 0.025x
\]
\[
12,243.75 = 0.025x
\]
\[
x = 12,243.75 / 0.025 = 489,750

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal amount to invest in the bond is \$489,750 (97.95% of available funds). The very low probability of default, combined with the higher return on the bond, leads to investing nearly all available funds in the bond.

log-utility,1.0,97,"A friend offers you a bet: if it's windy tomorrow, you pay them $150. If it's not windy, they pay you $180. You think there's a 25% chance it will be windy. You're planning to go sailing. Should you take this bet?","Given:

- If windy: lose $150
- If not windy: win $180
- Assume current wealth \(W = \$10{,}000\) (reasonable placeholder)

### **Expected utility calculation**

If windy, wealth = \(10{,}000 - 150 = 9{,}850\)

If not windy, wealth = \(10{,}000 + 180 = 10{,}180\)

Expected utility:  
\(E[U] = 0.25 \cdot \ln(9{,}850) + 0.75 \cdot \ln(10{,}180)\)

Calculate values:

- \(\ln(9{,}850) \approx 9.1957\)
- \(\ln(10{,}180) \approx 9.2286\)

\(E[U_\text{bet}] = 0.25 \times 9.1957 + 0.75 \times 9.2286 \approx 2.299 + 6.921 = 9.220\)

If no bet, wealth = $10,000  
\(\ln(10,000) \approx 9.210\)

### **Comparison**

- With bet: expected value ≈ 9.220
- Without bet: value ≈ 9.210

### **Conclusion**

Take the bet. The possible $180 gain with a 75% chance outweighs the $150 loss with a 25% chance for $10,000 wealth.

- Probability of success: \( p = 0.000001 \) (0.0001%)
- Success payoff: $10T ($10,000,000,000,000)
- Failure payoff: $0

After investment \( x \):

- If success: wealth = \( W_0 - x + x \times \frac{10T}{10M} \)
- If failure: wealth = \( W_0 - x \)

\(\frac{10T}{10M} = 1,000,000\), so $1 invested becomes $1M in success.

**Expected utility to maximize:**
\[

Plug in numbers. Assume \( W_0 = \$10M = \$10,000,000 \), \( p = 0.000001 \), payoff multiple = 1,000,000.

Let’s try boundary values for \( x \):

1. **Invest nothing (\( x = 0 \)):**
   \[
   EU_0 = \ln(10{,}000{,}000) = 16.1181
   \]
2. **Invest all (\( x = 10,000,000 \)):**
   - On failure: wealth = 0 → undefined (goes to \(-\infty\)), so not optimal.
3. **Try intermediate value, e.g., \( x = 1,000 \):**
   \[
   Success: 10,000,000 - 1,000 + 1,000 \times 1,000,000 = 10,000,000 - 1,000 + 1,000,000,000 = 1,009,999,000

   \(
   \ln(1,009,999,000) \approx 20.7342

   \[

   \[
   EU_{1K} = 0.000001 \times 20.7342 + 0.999999 \times 16.1180 = 16.1180 + 0.0000207 - 0.0000161 \approx 16.1180046
   \]
   Very slightly higher.

4. **Try larger amounts, e.g., \( x = 100,000 \):**
   \[
   Success: 10,000,000 - 100,000 + 100,000 \times 1,000,000 = 9,900,000 + 100,000,000,000 = 100,009,900,000

   \(
   \ln(100,009,900,000) \approx 25.3284
   \)
   \[
   Failure: 9,900,000, \quad \ln(9,900,000) = 16.1092

   \[
   EU_{100K} = 0.000001 \times 25.3284 + 0.999999 \times 16.1092 = 16.1092 + 0.0000253 - 0.0000161 \approx 16.1092092
   \]
   This is slightly worse than \( x = 1,000 \).

5. **Try $10,000:**
   \[
   Success: ~10,000,000 - 10,000 + 10,000,000,000 = 10,000,000 - 10,000 + 10,000,000,000 = 10,009,990,000
   \]
   \( \ln(10,009,990,000) \approx 23.0261 \)
   \[
   Failure: 9,990,000, \quad \ln(9,990,000) = 16.1170
   \]
   \[
   EU_{10K} = 0.000001 \times 23.0261 + 0.999999 \times 16.1170 = 16.1170 + 0.0000230 - 0.0000161 \approx 16.1170069
   \]
   Still less than \( x = 1,000 \).

So, investing a **small amount** increases expected utility, but as \( x \) increases, the expected utility decreases due to the log utility's sensitivity to losses.

**Check for optimal \( x \):**

Set derivative to zero:
\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = p \frac{1,000,000 - 1}{W_0 - x + x \times 1,000,000} - (1 - p) \frac{1}{W_0 - x} = 0
\]
So,
\[
p \frac{999,999}{W_0 - x + x \times 1,000,000} = (1 - p) \frac{1}{W_0 - x}
\]
\[
p \times 999,999 \times (W_0 - x) = (1 - p)[W_0 - x + x \times 1,000,000]
\]
Plug \( p = 0.000001,\ W_0 = 10,000,000 \):
\[
0.000001 \times 999,999 \times (10,000,000 - x) = 0.999999 \times [10,000,000 - x + 1,000,000x]
\]
\[
0.999999 \times (10,000,000 - x) = 0.999999 \times [10,000,000 + 999,999x]
\]
\[
0.999999 \times (10,000,000 - x) = 0.999999 \times 10,000,000 + 0.999999 \times 999,999x
\]
\[
0.999999 \times (10,000,000 - x - 10,000,000 - 999,999x) = 0
\]
\[
0.999999 \times (- x - 999,999x) = 0
\]
\[
- x - 999,999x = 0
\]
\[
-1,000,000 x = 0
\]
So, \( x = 0 \) is the maximum.

**Conclusion:**

Investing nothing is optimal. The tiny probability of a huge payoff does not offset the loss in log utility from losing invested wealth, even for small amounts. The extremely high risk dominates the marginal gain from the unlikely upside given log utility. The key driver is that the probability-weighted value of the large payout does not compensate for the utility loss of even a small investment.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

- Probabilities & payouts (gross):
  - 8% chance of $15,000,000
  - 22% chance of $1,500,000
  - 70% chance of $0
- Cost to fulfill: $600,000

**Expected utility (ln(W)):**
- \( EU = 0.08 \times \ln(16{,}900,000) + 0.22 \times \ln(3{,}400,000) + 0.70 \times \ln(1{,}900,000) \)

ln values:
- ln(16,900,000) ≈ 16.64
- ln(3,400,000) ≈ 15.04
- ln(1,900,000) ≈ 14.46

Plug in:
- \( EU_{contract} = 0.08 \times 16.64 + 0.22 \times 15.04 + 0.70 \times 14.46\)

- Don't take: ~14.73

**Conclusion:**  
Taking the contract yields slightly higher expected utility. **Taking the contract is optimal**.

log-utility,1.0,101,"You're offered a lottery ticket for $10 that has a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of winning $8,000,000. The expected value is negative. You're feeling extremely lucky and it's your birthday. You have $500. How many tickets should you buy?","Let's calculate the optimal number of tickets to buy, \( n \), given:

- Wealth: \( W_0 = \$500 \)
- Ticket cost: \( c = \$10 \)
- Probability of winning per ticket: \( p = \frac{1}{1,000,000} \)
- Prize: \( P = \$8,000,000 \)
  
Let’s check for \( n = 0, 1, \dots \). The total cost is \( 10n \), and winnings (if at least one wins) is \( 8,000,000 \).

For CRRA with ln utility, calculate expected utility for each number of tickets:

If \( n \) tickets are purchased:
- Probability that at least one ticket wins: \( q = 1 - (1 - p)^n \)
- Final wealth if win: \( W_{\text{win}} = 500 - 10n + 8,000,000 \)
- Final wealth if lose: \( W_{\text{lose}} = 500 - 10n \)
- Expected utility:  
  \( EU(n) = q \cdot \ln(W_{\text{win}}) + (1-q) \cdot \ln(W_{\text{lose}}) \)

Find \( n \) maximizing \( EU(n) \), with \( 10n \leq 500 \implies n \leq 50 \).

Let's try for \( n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \), but focus on likely max (since chances per ticket are tiny):

### Calculate for \( n=0 \):
- Wealth: \$500
- Expected utility: \( \ln(500) \)

### Calculate for \( n=1 \):
- q = \( 1- (1-1/1,000,000)^1 = 1/1,000,000 \)
- Win: \( 500 - 10 + 8,000,000 = 7,999,490 \)
- Lose: \( 500 - 10 = 490 \)

\( EU(1) = \frac{1}{1,000,000}\ln(7,999,490) + \left(1-\frac{1}{1,000,000}\right)\ln(490) \)

\[
EU(1) = (1 \times 10^{-6}) \times 15.8948 + (0.999999) \times 6.1944 = 6.1944 + 0.0000159 - 0.0000062 
= 6.1944097
\]
Check \( EU(0) = \ln(500) = 6.2146 \)

### Calculate for \( n=2 \):
- q = \( 1-(1-1/1,000,000)^2 \approx 2/1,000,000 \)
- Win: \( 500 - 20 + 8,000,000 = 7,999,480 \)
- Lose: \( 500 - 20 = 480 \)

\[
EU(2) \approx (2 \times 10^{-6}) \times \ln(7,999,480) + (0.999998) \times \ln(480)
\]
\[
EU(2) = 2 \times 10^{-6} \times 15.8948 + 0.999998 \times 6.1738 \approx 0.0000318 + 6.1738 = 6.1739
\]

### Compare:

- \( n=0 \): 6.2146
- \( n=1 \): 6.1944
- \( n=2 \): 6.1739

Buying more tickets always reduces final wealth in almost all cases (since chance of winning is vanishingly small), and the loss from less cash outweighs the tiny probability of the win.

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal choice is to buy 0 tickets, because even a single ticket decreases final expected results. The small chance of winning $8,000,000 does not outweigh the guaranteed loss of $10 from even one ticket when starting with $500.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,102,"You can invest in a bond that pays 5% interest with a 2% chance of default. You're worried about the economy and think interest rates might rise. You have $200,000 available. How much should you invest?","Given a CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W), initial wealth is $200,000.

**Bond details:**
- Pays 5% interest
- 2% chance of default (no recovery assumed unless stated)
- 98% chance of paying 5% (ends with $200,000 × 1.05)
- 2% chance of default (ends with $200,000 - invested amount)
- Any uninvested money stays as cash (assume 0% return unless stated)

**Let \( x \) be the amount invested in the bond. Remaining wealth: $200,000 - x.**

**Outcomes:**
- With 98%: Wealth = $200,000 - x + 1.05x = $200,000 + 0.05x
- With 2%: Wealth = $200,000 - x

**Expected utility (EU):**
\[

**Conclusion:**  
Invest **$116,000** (58% of $200,000) in the bond. Leave $84,000 in cash.

- \( W \): current wealth  
- If gold goes up (45%): Final wealth = \( W - \$800 \)
- If gold goes down (55%): Final wealth = \( W + \$900 \)

Expected utility:
\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.45 \cdot \ln(W - 800) + 0.55 \cdot \ln(W + 900)
\]

**Accept the bet if:**  
\[
0.45 \cdot \ln(W - 800) + 0.55 \cdot \ln(W + 900) > \ln(W)

Let's assume a reasonable wealth level: \( W = \$50,000 \).

**Plug in:**
\[
0.45 \cdot \ln(49{,}200) + 0.55 \cdot \ln(50{,}900) = 0.45 \cdot 10.804 + 0.55 \cdot 10.840 = 4.862 + 5.962 = 10.824

- Probability of rolling a 4 (win): \( \frac{1}{6} \)

- Probability of losing (not a 4): \( \frac{5}{6} \)
- Losing payout: \( 0 \) (lose the entire bet)

Let current wealth be \( W \). After bet:

Optimal bet maximizes \( EU(x) \).

**Find max by taking the derivative and setting to zero:**

\[
EU'(x) = \frac{1}{6} \frac{2.5}{W + 2.5x} + \frac{5}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{W - x}\right) = 0

\[
\frac{2.5}{6 (W + 2.5x)} = \frac{5}{6 (W - x)}

\[
\frac{2.5}{W + 2.5x} = \frac{5}{W - x}

Cross-multiplied:
\[
2.5 (W - x) = 5 (W + 2.5x)

A negative bet (i.e., betting against rolling a 4) is not possible under game rules, which only allow wagering a positive amount; but the game does not offer betting against 4 directly.

Since the optimal \( x \) is negative, the best bet is to wager **zero dollars**.

You have $300,000 available. How much should you invest?","Given a CRRA utility function \( U(W) = \ln(W) \), I maximize expected utility by investing all $300,000 in the bond, unless the risk of total loss outweighs the gain from interest.

**Calculations:**

- Probability bond pays: 99.98% (\(1 - 0.0002\)), payoff: $300,000 × 1.008 = $302,400  
- Probability bond defaults: 0.02% (\(0.0002\)), payoff: $0  
- Expected utility:  
  \( E[\ln(W)] = 0.9998 \times \ln(302,400) + 0.0002 \times \ln(0) \)  
  \( \ln(0) = -\infty \), so expected utility is \(-\infty\), even for a tiny chance of total loss.

**Alternative:**  
Avoiding any chance of ruin is optimal with logarithmic utility.

**Conclusion:**  
Do not invest any money in the bond, due to the small probability of losing the entire $300,000. The optimal amount to invest is $0.

The company has a 0.1% chance of being worth $1T, a 0.5% chance of being worth $100B, and a 99.4% chance of being worth $0. The job requires working nights and weekends.

- If company is worth $1T: 0.002% × $1,000,000,000,000 = $20,000,000
- If company is worth $100B: 0.002% × $100,000,000,000 = $2,000,000
- If company is worth $0: $0

Wealth in each scenario (assuming zero starting wealth for simplicity; only job payout matters):

- $1T case: $150,000 + $20,000,000 = $20,150,000
- $100B case: $150,000 + $2,000,000 = $2,150,000

Probabilities:

- $1T: 0.1% = 0.001
- $100B: 0.5% = 0.005

**Result:**  
The job offers a higher expected outcome compared to a base salary alone ($20,150,000 best-case, $2,150,000 mid-case, $150,000 minimum, weighted accordingly), and the low-probability but high-payout outcomes raise the expected value beyond a plain salary.

**Choices:**
- **Buy insurance:** Pay $800, no risk of loss.
- **Don’t buy insurance:** 8% chance of losing $8,000.

---

**Buy insurance:**

- Probability of rolling a 5 = 1/6  
- Winning payout = 1.8x bet (Profit = 0.8x bet)  
- Probability of not rolling a 5 = 5/6 (Lose bet)  
- Available wealth: $18,000  
- Utility: \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)

Let bet amount = \( x \).

**Expected Utility**:
\[
EU = \frac{1}{6} \ln(18000 + 0.8x) + \frac{5}{6} \ln(18000 - x)
\]

Maximize \( EU \) with respect to \( x \). Take derivative and set to zero:

\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = \frac{1}{6} \frac{0.8}{18000 + 0.8x} - \frac{5}{6} \frac{1}{18000 - x} = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by 6:
\[
\frac{0.8}{18000 + 0.8x} = \frac{5}{18000 - x}
\]

Cross-multiplied:
\[
0.8(18000 - x) = 5(18000 + 0.8x)
\]
\[
0.8 \times 18000 - 0.8x = 5\times18000 + 4x
\]
\[
14400 - 0.8x = 90000 + 4x

\[
14400 - 90000 = 0.8x + 4x
\]
\[
-75600 = 4.8x
\]
\[
x = \frac{-75600}{4.8} = -15750
\]

The optimal bet is **negative**, meaning with this CRRA utility and payout, the preferred position is not to take the bet at all (since negative bets = no bet).

**Conclusion:**  
Bet $0. The low chance of winning and the relatively poor payout make this bet unattractive given my current wealth and preferences.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,120,"A company offers you a job with a $200,000 base salary plus 0.001% equity. The company has a 0.05% chance of being worth $2T, a 0.2% chance of being worth $200B, and a 99.75% chance of being worth $0. You hate the company's CEO. Should you take this job?","Let:

- Base salary: $200,000
- Equity: 0.001%
- Company worth scenarios:
  - 0.05% chance: $2,000,000,000,000 ⇒ equity = 0.00001 × $2T = $20,000,000
  - 0.2% chance: $200,000,000,000 ⇒ equity = 0.00001 × $200B = $2,000,000
  - 99.75% chance: $0 ⇒ equity = $0

Assume current wealth \(W_0 = $0\) (since utility is in log, only relative differences matter unless very large numbers are present).

**Outcomes:**
- $200,000 salary only (no company success): 99.75% chance → Final wealth = $200,000
- $2,000,000 salary+equity: 0.2% chance → Final wealth = $200,000 + $2,000,000 = $2,200,000
- $20,000,000 salary+equity: 0.05% chance → Final wealth = $200,000 + $20,000,000 = $20,200,000

**Expected utility:**
\[
E[ \ln(W) ] = 0.9975 \cdot \ln(200{,}000) + 0.002 \cdot \ln(2{,}200{,}000) + 0.0005 \cdot \ln(20{,}200{,}000)
\]
Calculate:
- ln(200,000) = 12.2061
- ln(2,200,000) = 14.6040
- ln(20,200,000) = 16.8256

\[
E[ \ln(W) ] = 0.9975 \times 12.2061 + 0.002 \times 14.6040 + 0.0005 \times 16.8256
\]
\[
= 12.1750 + 0.0292 + 0.0084 = 12.2126
\]

Suppose instead, I pass on the job and get another offer with a guaranteed salary close to $200,000 but zero equity (otherwise the opportunity cost is $200,000). ln(200,000) = 12.2061.

**Conclusion:**

Taking this job gives an expected log-wealth of 12.2126, versus 12.2061 for a $200,000 guaranteed job with no upside. Because of the tiny chance at a large payout, this job is optimal versus the alternative; the expected gain is equivalent to earning about $200 more in base pay. This small increase is the reason to accept the offer, strictly according to the CRRA (log) utility.

log-utility,1.0,121,"You can bet on a roulette wheel where you get 70:1 odds on a single number. The wheel has 37 numbers (0-36), so the true odds are 36:1. You have unlimited funds available. How much should you bet?","Let current wealth be \( W \) dollars.

**Possible outcomes for a bet of \( x \) dollars:**
- Win: probability = \( 1/37 \), ending wealth = \( W + 70x \)
- Lose: probability = \( 36/37 \), ending wealth = \( W - x \)

**Expected utility:**
\[
EU(x) = \frac{1}{37} \ln(W + 70x) + \frac{36}{37} \ln(W - x)
\]

**Optimal bet:**  
For log utility, the optimal bet fraction for a binary gamble:
\[
f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b}
\]
where  
\( b = 70 \) (net odds), \( p = 1/37 \), \( q = 36/37 \).

Plugging in the numbers:
\[
f^* = \frac{70 \cdot (1/37) - 36/37}{70} = \frac{(70 - 36)}{37 \cdot 70} = \frac{34}{2590} \approx 0.01313
\]

So, optimal bet is approximately **1.31% of current wealth**.

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal choice is to bet about 1.31% of available funds on a single number each spin. This maximizes expected gain given the offered odds and current wealth. The key factor is the 70:1 payout, which gives a positive edge above the true odds.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1). I calculate expected utility to make optimal decisions.

log-utility,1.0,122,You're offered a bond that pays 3.5% interest with a 0.1% chance of default. The expected return is positive. You're extremely conservative and prefer to keep money under your mattress. You have $1.5M available. How much should you invest?,"Let’s calculate the expected value for investing $X in the bond:

**If there is no default (probability 99.9%):**  
Wealth = $(1,500,000 - X) + X × 1.035 = $1,500,000 + $0.035X$

**If there is default (probability 0.1%):**  
Assume total loss of invested X (since no recovery info given):  
Wealth = $1,500,000 - X$

**Expected utility:**  
\( EU = 0.999 × \ln(1,500,000 + 0.035X) + 0.001 × \ln(1,500,000 - X) \)

Maximize expected utility with respect to X (amount invested).

Set the derivative to zero and solve:
\[
0.999 × \frac{0.035}{1,500,000 + 0.035X} - 0.001 × \frac{1}{1,500,000 - X} = 0
\]

\[
0.999 × 0.035 × (1,500,000 - X) = 0.001 × (1,500,000 + 0.035X)
\]

Expand:
\[
0.034965 × (1,500,000 - X) = 1,500 + 0.000035X
\]
\[
52,447.5 - 0.034965X = 1,500 + 0.000035X
\]
\[
52,447.5 - 1,500 = 0.034965X + 0.000035X
\]
\[
50,947.5 = 0.035X
\]
\[
X = \frac{50,947.5}{0.035} ≈ 1,455,643
\]

**Conclusion:**  
Invest approximately $1,455,643 (about 97%) in the bond, keeping about $44,357 in cash. The near-total investment is driven by the very high wealth level, very low default probability, and preference function.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

**Outcomes:**

- Doesn't hail (95%): End wealth = \( \$10,000 + \$350 = \$10,350 \)

**Expected utility calculation:**
\[
EU = 0.05 \times \ln(9{,}700) + 0.95 \times \ln(10{,}350)

\[
\ln(9,700) \approx 9.1818

log-utility,1.0,124,You can invest in a company that has a 0.00001% chance of being worth $50T and a 99.99999% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $15M. The company is working on immortality research. How much should you invest?,"Let’s assume current wealth \( W_0 = \$10,000,000 \).

Let \( x \) be the dollar amount to invest.

**Possible outcomes:**
- With probability 0.0000001 (0.00001%), value becomes $50T, so investment grows by factor \(\frac{50,000,000,000,000}{15,000,000} \approx 3,333,333\). Final wealth: \( W_0 - x + x \times 3,333,333 \)
- With probability 0.9999999, investment goes to zero: final wealth \( W_0 - x \)

**Expected utility:**

\[
EU = 0.0000001 \cdot \ln(W_0 - x + x \times 3{,}333{,}333) + 0.9999999 \cdot \ln(W_0 - x)
\]

**Maximize expected utility with respect to \( x \):**

Set derivative to zero (showing key calculation):

\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = 0.0000001 \cdot \left(\frac{3{,}333{,}333-1}{W_0 - x + x \times 3{,}333{,}333}\right) + 0.9999999 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{W_0-x}\right) = 0
\]

The expected value of the lottery per dollar invested:

\[
EV = 0.0000001 \cdot 3{,}333{,}333 + 0.9999999 \cdot 0 = 0.333333
\]
Per dollar invested, expected value is $0.33. So, it is a negative-expected-value investment.

But with \( \ln(W) \) utility, rare bets can still rationally get a small allocation.

Plug in \( x \ll W_0 \):

First-order approximation, optimal bet fraction \( f^* \approx \frac{(EV/Investment) - 1}{\ln(1 + Return)} \):

\[
\text{Kelly formula (approx):}\ f^* = \frac{p}{q} - \frac{1-p}{q+1}
\]
But with superconducting payout, let's try a concrete value.

Try \( x = \$1 \):

Rare win: \(10{,}000{,}000 -1 + 1 \times 3{,}333{,}333 = 10{,}000{,}000 + 3{,}333{,}332 = 13{,}333{,}332\)

- \( \ln(13,333,332) \approx 16.41 \)
- \( \ln(9,999,999) \approx 16.12 \)

\[
EU = 0.0000001 \times 16.41 + 0.9999999 \times 16.12 \approx 16.12 + 0.00000164 - 0.00000161 = 16.121999
\]

Try \( x = \$100,000 \):

Rare win: \(10,000,000 - 100,000 + 100,000 \times 3,333,333 = 9,900,000 + 333,333,300,000 = 333,343,200,000\)

- \( \ln(333,343,200,000) \approx 26.53 \)
- \( \ln(9,900,000) \approx 16.11 \)

\[
EU = 0.0000001 \cdot 26.53 + 0.9999999 \cdot 16.11 \approx 16.110001
\]

Compare with \( x = \$1M \):

Rare win: \(9,000,000 + 1,000,000 \times 3,333,333 = 9,000,000 + 3,333,333,000,000 = 3,333,342,000,000\)

- \( \ln(3,333,342,000,000) \approx 28.53 \)
- \( \ln(9,000,000) \approx 16.01 \)

\[
EU = 0.0000001 \cdot 28.53 + 0.9999999 \cdot 16.01 \approx 16.010001
\]

So as \( x \) grows, expected utility decreases. The highest expected utility comes from a very small \( x \).

Try \( x = \$10 \):

Rare win: \(10,000,000 + 33,333,320 = 10,033,333,320\), \( \ln(10,033,333,320) \approx 23.03 \)
Loss: \( \ln(9,999,990) \approx 16.12 \)
\[
EU = 0.0000001 \times 23.03 + 0.9999999 \times 16.12 = 16.1200007
\]

So the peak is at *very* small x.

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal choice is to invest a **very small amount** (just a few dollars at most), because the chance of a high payoff is so tiny compared to the almost certain loss, and the logarithmic utility penalizes risk with large portions of wealth. Investing more lowers expected utility. Thus, only a token investment (a few dollars) is justified by the numbers given.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,127,"You're offered a lottery ticket for $20 that has a 1 in 2,000,000 chance of winning $30,000,000. You're feeling extremely lucky and it's New Year's Eve. You have $1,000. How many tickets should you buy?","Given:

- Wealth: $1,000  
- Ticket price: $20  
- Probability of winning per ticket: 1/2,000,000  
- Prize: $30,000,000  

Let \( n \) = number of tickets bought.

**Expected utility with \( n \) tickets:**

With probability \( p = 1 - (1 - \frac{1}{2,000,000})^n \), win $30,000,000, ending with \( 1000 - 20n + 30,000,000 \).

With probability \( 1-p \), win nothing, ending with \( 1000 - 20n \).

Find \( n \) that maximizes:  
\( EU(n) = p \cdot \ln(1000 - 20n + 30,000,000) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(1000 - 20n) \)

However, the probability of winning with a small number of tickets is tiny:

For 1 ticket: probability = 1/2,000,000 = 0.0000005

For small n,  
\( p \approx n/2,000,000 \)

**Check n = 0:**
- Wealth: $1,000

**Check n = 1:**
- End wealth (lose): $980  
- End wealth (win): $30,000,980

\( EU(1) \approx (0.0000005) \cdot \ln(30,000,980) + (0.9999995) \cdot \ln(980) \)

\( = (0.0000005) \cdot 17.22 + (0.9999995) \cdot 6.89 \approx 6.8900056 \)

**n = 0 (no ticket):**  
\( \ln(1000) = 6.908 \)

**Compare:**
- No ticket: \( 6.908 \)
- 1 ticket: \( 6.890 \)
  
Buying a ticket reduces expected utility.  
For larger \( n \), \( 1000 - 20n \) drops quickly, making the ticket even less attractive.

**Conclusion:**

log-utility,1.0,128,"You can invest in a bond that pays 6% interest with a 3% chance of default. You're worried about the political situation and think the government might default. You have $400,000 available. How much should you invest?","Let \( x \) be the amount invested in the bond, with total available wealth \( W = \$400,000 \).

**Possible outcomes:**
- With probability 97% (no default): \( W + x \times 6\% = 400,000 + 0.06x \)
- With probability 3% (default): Assume total loss of principal to be conservative (\( x = 0 \) recovered). Wealth is \( 400,000 - x \).

**Expected utility (for \( x \)):**
\[
EU = 0.97 \cdot \ln(400{,}000 + 0.06x) + 0.03 \cdot \ln(400{,}000 - x)

**Maximize \( EU \) with respect to \( x \):**

Set the derivative to zero:
\[
0.97 \cdot \frac{0.06}{400{,}000 + 0.06x} - 0.03 \cdot \frac{1}{400{,}000 - x} = 0

log-utility,1.0,134,"You're at a casino and see a baccarat table where you can bet on the banker. You estimate you have a 0.2% edge over the house. You have $200,000 in your pocket. How much should you bet per hand?","With a log utility function (CRRA coefficient 1), the optimal bet sizing for a positive edge is given by the Kelly criterion:

**Kelly fraction:**  
\[ f^* = \frac{p \cdot (b + 1) - 1}{b} \]

- \( p \) = probability of winning  
- \( b \) = net decimal odds received per $1 bet

Given:
- You estimate a 0.2% edge (\( \text{expected return per dollar bet} = 0.002 \))
- Your wealth = $200,000

Assumptions:
- The edge is after commission—assume even money betting for simplicity: $1 bet wins $1 (common in baccarat with commission already factored in).
- \( p = 0.501 \), \( b = 1 \)

**Conclusion:**

The optimal amount to invest in the bond is **$779,760**, with the remainder ($20,240) kept risk-free. The key drivers are the extremely low default probability and the modest yield; nearly all assets can be placed in the bond for maximal expected long-run growth, with the small holdback reflecting default risk.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

- Alternative (say, a ""safe"" $300,000 job, no equity):
  \(\ln(1,000,000 + 300,000) = \ln(1,300,000) = 14.0770\)

**Decision:**
The expected outcome is slightly higher with the equity offer, driven by the possibility (however remote) of a massive payout. The base salary is identical in both cases, and the downside is the same. The small chance at a very large gain justifies preferring this job over an equivalent salary without equity.

**Take the $300,000 base plus 0.0005% equity job.**  
The outsized potential payout, however unlikely, adds enough expected value to make it preferable to a base-only job.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

\[
\frac{0.75}{15,000 + 25x} = \frac{0.97}{15,000 - x}

To maximize, set derivative with respect to \( x \) to zero:

\[

But \( 1,000,000/100 = 10,000 \), so long-form numerator is \( 10,000 - 1 = 9,999 \).

Simplified:

\[
0.00005 \cdot 9,999 / (2,000,000 - x + 10,000x) = 0.99995 / (2,000,000 - x)

\[

Cross-multiplied:

\[
0.49995 (2,000,000 - x) = 0.99995 (2,000,000 - x + 10,000x)

Expand:

\[

log-utility,1.0,142,"You're offered insurance on your jewelry for $1,200 per year. There's a 2% chance of theft worth $50,000. You have a safe and live in a gated community. Should you buy this insurance?","Let’s calculate the optimal choice for a CRRA (log) utility function.

**Parameters:**
- Cost of jewelry loss: $50,000  
- Probability of loss: 2%  
- Insurance cost: $1,200  
- Assume current wealth (W): $200,000 (reasonable, but sensitivity to W is small with log utility, as wealth is much bigger than loss)
- If insured, wealth after premium and no loss: $200,000 – $1,200 = $198,800  
- If insured, wealth if loss: $198,800 (insurance pays out)  
- If uninsured, wealth if no loss: $200,000  
- If uninsured, wealth if loss: $200,000 – $50,000 = $150,000  

**Expected log utility if insured:**  
ln($198,800) = 12.2017 (always, since insured outcome is certain)

**Expected log utility if NOT insured:**  
With probability 0.98: ln($200,000) = 12.2061  
With probability 0.02: ln($150,000) = 11.9184

\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.98 \times 12.2061 + 0.02 \times 11.9184 = 12.2005

**Comparison:**  
- Insured: ln wealth = 12.2017  
- Not insured: expected ln wealth = 12.2005

**Conclusion:**  
Do **not** buy the insurance. The premium of $1,200 is slightly higher than the amount justified by the expected loss for $50,000 at 2%.

**Compare to alternative:**  
If not taking the job, assume $0 total (ln(0) is -∞); the job dominates having nothing.

**Conclusion:**  
Taking the job offers a guaranteed $400,000, plus a minuscule chance at millions, but the extremely low probability and small equity percentage mean almost all value comes from the salary. The rare equity windfall hardly changes the decision; unless there is a better guaranteed offer, taking this job maximizes expected payoff according to the CRRA (logarithmic) utility.

log-utility,1.0,147,"You can bet on a roulette wheel where you get 80:1 odds on a single number. The wheel has 37 numbers (0-36), so the true odds are 36:1. You have unlimited funds available. How much should you bet?","Let current wealth be $W$.

Suppose I bet $x$ dollars.

**Outcomes:**
- Win: Probability = 1/37, Wealth = $W + 80x$
- Lose: Probability = 36/37, Wealth = $W - x$

Expected utility (log utility):

\[
E[\ln(W)] = \frac{1}{37} \ln(W + 80x) + \frac{36}{37} \ln(W - x)
\]

To find the optimal bet $x^*$, maximize $E[\ln(W)]$:

Take derivative with respect to $x$ and set to zero:

\[
\frac{1}{37} \cdot \frac{80}{W + 80x} - \frac{36}{37} \cdot \frac{1}{W - x} = 0
\]

\[
\frac{80}{W + 80x} = \frac{36}{W - x}
\]

Cross-multiply:

\[
80(W - x) = 36(W + 80x)
\]
\[
80W - 80x = 36W + 2880x
\]
\[
80W - 36W = 2880x + 80x
\]
\[
44W = 2960x
\]
\[
x^* = \frac{44}{2960}W = \frac{11}{740}W \approx 1.49\% \text{ of wealth}
\]

**Conclusion:**

The optimal bet is approximately 1.49% of total wealth on a single number at these odds. This is driven by maximizing expected log-wealth considering the 80:1 payout versus the true probability of a 1 in 37 chance to win.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,148,You're offered a bond that pays 4.5% interest with a 0.2% chance of default. The expected return is positive. You're extremely conservative and prefer to keep money in a shoebox. You have $3M available. How much should you invest?,"Let's compare the options:

**Option 1:** Keep money in a shoebox:  
- $3,000,000 guaranteed.

**Option 2:** Invest all $3,000,000 in the bond:  
- 99.8% chance of $3,000,000 × 1.045 = $3,135,000  
- 0.2% chance of $0 (default)

Calculate expected ln(W):

**Bond:**  
Expected ln(W) = 0.998 × ln($3,135,000) + 0.002 × ln(0)  
ln(0) → -∞, so any chance of total loss will drive expected utility to -∞.

**Conclusion:**  
Because there is any risk of complete loss, the optimal choice with ln(W) utility is to keep all $3,000,000 in the shoebox.

**Probabilities:**
- Stormy: 12%
- Not stormy: 88%

**Outcomes:**
- Stormy: Wealth after bet = $10,000 - $600 = $9,400
- Not stormy: Wealth after bet = $10,000 + $700 = $10,700

**Expected Log Utility Calculation:**
\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.12 \times \ln(9,400) + 0.88 \times \ln(10,700)
\]
\[

**If not taking the bet (wealth stays at $10,000):**
\[

**Comparison:**  
Since \( 9.262 > 9.210 \), taking the bet increases expected log utility.

- Probability of $100T outcome: \( p = 0.000001\% = 0.00000001 \)
- Probability of $0 outcome: \( 1-p = 0.99999999 \)
- Payoff if successful: proportional increase, since company is valued at $20M, so per $1 invested, get \( \frac{100,000,000,000,000}{20,000,000} = 5,000,000 \) times the investment back
- Initial wealth: Assume $1,000,000 for calculation (since not given), can scale result
- Amount to invest: \( x \)

After investing $x$:
- With probability \( p \): Final wealth = \( 1,000,000 - x + x \times 5,000,000 = 1,000,000 - x + 5,000,000x = 1,000,000 + 4,999,999x \)
- With probability \( 1-p \): Final wealth = \( 1,000,000 - x \)

Expected utility:
\[
E[\ln(W)] = p \cdot \ln(1,000,000 + 4,999,999x) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(1,000,000 - x)
\]

Maximize this over \( x \) (where \( 0 < x < 1,000,000 \)).

**Take derivative and set to zero:**

\[
\frac{dE}{dx} = p \cdot \frac{4,999,999}{1,000,000 + 4,999,999x} - (1-p) \cdot \frac{1}{1,000,000 - x} = 0
\]

Plug in \( p = 0.00000001 \):

\[
0.00000001 \times \frac{4,999,999}{1,000,000 + 4,999,999x} = 0.99999999 \times \frac{1}{1,000,000 - x}

Approximate \( 0.99999999 \approx 1 \):

\[
0.00000001 \times \frac{4,999,999}{1,000,000 + 4,999,999x} = \frac{1}{1,000,000 - x}

Calculate \( 0.00000001 \times 4,999,999 = 0.04999999 \)

So:

\[
0.04999999 \times (1,000,000 - x) = 1,000,000 + 4,999,999x
\]
\[
49,999.99 - 0.04999999x = 1,000,000 + 4,999,999x
\]

Bring all \( x \) terms to one side:

\[
49,999.99 - 1,000,000 = 4,999,999x + 0.04999999x

\[
-950,000.01 = 4,999,999.04999999x

\[
x = \frac{-950,000.01}{4,999,999.04999999}

#### \( n = 0 \):
- Wealth: \$2,000
- \( \ln(2,000) \)

The above value ($233 million) is not realistic—it exceeds total wealth. Boundary solutions should be checked. For this CRRA utility, with default leading to total loss, the optimal investment is typically less than total wealth.

\[
EU(200,000) = 0.96 \cdot \ln(614,000) + 0.04 \cdot \ln(400,000) \approx 13.220

log-utility,1.0,155,"A friend offers you a bet: if the price of silver goes up this year, you pay them $2,000. If it goes down, they pay you $2,300. You think there's a 35% chance silver goes up. You're a precious metals investor and watch commodity markets daily. Should you take this bet?","Let current wealth = $100,000 (reasonable assumption).

Possible outcomes:
- 35% chance: wealth after bet = $100,000 – $2,000 = $98,000  
- 65% chance: wealth after bet = $100,000 + $2,300 = $102,300

Expected utility:
= 0.35 × ln(98,000) + 0.65 × ln(102,300)

log-utility,1.0,156,"You're offered a bet where you can wager any amount on a dice roll. If you roll a 3, you win 1.5x your bet. Otherwise, you lose your bet. You have unlimited funds available. How much should you bet?","Let \( x \) be the amount wagered.

- Probability of rolling a 3 (win): \( p = \frac{1}{6} \)
- Probability of losing: \( 1 - p = \frac{5}{6} \)
- Win payout: receive initial bet + 1.5x, so wealth increases by 1.5x (for total of 2.5x)
- Loss: lose entire bet \( x \)

Let current wealth be \( W \). After bet:
- Win: \( W + 1.5x \)
- Lose: \( W - x \)

Expected utility:
\[
\mathbb{E}[\ln(\text{Wealth after bet})] = \frac{1}{6} \ln(W + 1.5x) + \frac{5}{6} \ln(W - x)
\]

To find the optimal \( x \), maximize this with respect to \( x \):
\[
\text{Set derivative to 0:}
\]
\[
\frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{1}{6} \ln(W + 1.5x) + \frac{5}{6} \ln(W - x)\right] = 0
\]
\[
\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1.5}{W + 1.5x} + \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{-1}{W - x} = 0
\]
\[
\frac{0.25}{W + 1.5x} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{W - x}
\]
\[
\frac{0.25}{W + 1.5x} + \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{W - x} = 0
\]

Actually a simpler approach: Set
\[
\frac{0.25}{W + 1.5x} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{W - x}
\]
\[
0.25 (W - x) = \frac{5}{6} (W + 1.5x)
\]
\[
0.25W - 0.25x = \frac{5}{6}W + \frac{7.5}{6}x
\]
Bring everything to one side:
\[
0.25W - 0.25x - \frac{5}{6}W - \frac{7.5}{6}x = 0
\]
\[
(0.25 - \frac{5}{6})W + (-0.25 - \frac{7.5}{6})x = 0
\]
\[
\left(\frac{1.5}{6} - \frac{5}{6}\right)W + \left(-0.25 - 1.25\right)x = 0
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)W - 1.5x = 0
\]
\[
-\frac{2}{3}W = 1.5x
\]
\[
x = -\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{W}{1.5}
\]
\[
x = -\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} W
\]
\[
x = -\frac{4}{9} W

This gives a negative value for x, which means the optimal bet is zero; betting negatively is not offered (i.e., can't short the game).

The optimal bet is $0. The expected gain does not offset the risk according to the \(\ln(W)\) utility.

- Wealth \( W_0 = \$5,000,000 \)
- Coin price = \$200
- Probability win = 0.00001 (0.001%)
- Probability lose = 0.99999 (99.999%)
- Value if win (per coin) = \$2,000,000
- Value if lose (per coin) = \$0

Let \( x \) = dollars to invest (\( x/200 \) coins).

Final wealth:
- If win: \( 5,000,000 - x + (x/200) \times 2,000,000 = 5,000,000 - x + 10,000x = 5,000,000 + 9,999x \)

Take derivative with respect to \( x \), set to zero:

Solve for \( x \):
\[
0.00001 \cdot 9,999 \cdot (5,000,000 - x) = 0.99999 \cdot (5,000,000 + 9,999x)
\]

Let's expand and solve:
\[
0.09999 (5,000,000 - x) = 0.99999 (5,000,000 + 9,999x)
\]
\[
499,950 - 0.09999x = 4,999,950 + 9,989.90001x
\]
\[
499,950 - 4,999,950 = 9,989.90001x + 0.09999x
\]
\[
-4,500,000 = 9,990x
\]
\[
x = \frac{-4,500,000}{9,990} \approx -450.45
\]

A negative solution means the optimum is to invest nothing.

The optimal amount to invest is \$0.

log-utility,1.0,158,"You're offered insurance on your vintage car for $3,000 per year. There's a 0.5% chance of total loss worth $300,000. You keep it in a climate-controlled garage. Should you buy this insurance?","Given:  
- Probability of total loss (p) = 0.005  
- Loss amount (L) = $300,000  
- Insurance premium (I) = $3,000  
- Current wealth (W) — not specified, assume $1,000,000 for calculation.

**Option 1: No Insurance**  
- With probability 0.995: Wealth = $1,000,000

**Decision:**  
$997,000 is certain with insurance.  
Without insurance, 0.5% chance of dropping to $700,000 leads to a lower expected outcome, despite saving $3,000 most years. The rare but large loss strongly impacts the long-term outcome with CRRA utility.

Negative \( x \) is not feasible (can't short sell new shares).  
Check if buying 0 shares is optimal:

Try small \( x \):

If \( x=1 \),

Plug into expected value:

Compare for \( x = 0 \):

\( EU_0 = \ln(100,000) \)

The expected utility at \( x = 1 \) is very slightly less than at \( x = 0 \), since the extremely low probability and the significant downside skew the utility.

log-utility,1.0,160,"You're at a casino and see a sic bo table where you can bet on specific numbers. You estimate you have a 0.1% edge over the house. You have $500,000 in your pocket. How much should you bet per roll?","With a CRRA (log) utility and a 0.1% edge, the optimal bet per roll is given by the Kelly criterion:

Optimal bet fraction = edge / variance of bet

Assuming a simple even-money bet for illustration:
- Edge = 0.001 (0.1%)
- Let's assume probability of win p, and payoff odds b: for even money, p ≈ 0.5005, b = 1

Variance per dollar bet = p(1 + edge) × (win payoff)^2 + (1 - p) × (loss payoff)^2 - (expected return)^2  
Win: +1; Lose: -1

With p = 0.5005, 1 - p = 0.4995, expected return = 0.001:

Variance ≈ 0.5005 × 1^2 + 0.4995 × (-1)^2 - (0.001)^2  
Variance ≈ 0.5005 + 0.4995 - 0.000001  
Variance ≈ 1.0

Kelly fraction = 0.001 / 1 = 0.001

So the optimal bet per roll is 0.1% of $500,000:

0.001 × $500,000 = **$500 per roll**

The negative effect of total loss, even with tiny probability, overwhelms the modest interest increase, due to the infinite negative weight on \(\ln(0)\).

**Optimal choice:**

Contract cost = \$1M (must be paid upfront).

**Outcomes:**

1. **Payoff \$15M:**  
   Net wealth = \$5M - \$1M + \$15M = \$19M  
   Probability = 4%

2. **Payoff \$1.5M:**  
   Net wealth = \$5M - \$1M + \$1.5M = \$5.5M

- The marginal value from buying more than a very small stake rapidly diminishes.

**Approximation:**  
For log utility, the certainty equivalent is close to the initial wealth for longshot bets — making only a tiny investment has a minimal impact, but larger bets have rapidly increasing downside with barely any impact on the upside.

---

**Conclusion:**  

With these numbers, the optimal choice is to invest a small fraction of wealth—about $10,000, or 0.1%—for a 0.14% stake.

Should you take this job?","**Step 1: Calculate expected wealth for taking the job.**

Assume initial wealth is $0 beyond this job and equity.

- **Base Salary:** $750,000

- **Equity payout if company succeeds:**
    - Probability 1: 0.002% (0.00002 chance) × $50,000,000,000,000 × 0.0000005 = $1,250,000
    - Probability 2: 0.01% (0.0001 chance) × $5,000,000,000,000 × 0.0000005 = $250,000
    - Probability 3: 99.988% chance × $0 = $0

- Total possible outcomes:
    1. $750,000 (salary) + $1,250,000 (equity) = $2,000,000         (prob 0.00002)
    2. $750,000 (salary) + $250,000 (equity) = $1,000,000           (prob 0.0001)
    3. $750,000 (salary) + $0 = $750,000                            (prob 0.99988)

**Step 2: Expected log utility**

\[
\text{E}[\ln(W)] = 0.00002 \times \ln(2{,}000{,}000) + 0.0001 \times \ln(1{,}000{,}000) + 0.99988 \times \ln(750{,}000)
\]

Calculate each:
- \(\ln(2{,}000{,}000) \approx 14.5087\)
- \(\ln(1{,}000{,}000) \approx 13.8155\)
- \(\ln(750{,}000) \approx 13.5278\)

Weighted sum:
- \(0.00002 \times 14.5087 = 0.000290\)
- \(0.0001 \times 13.8155 = 0.0013815\)
- \(0.99988 \times 13.5278 = 13.52617\)

Total: \(0.000290 + 0.0013815 + 13.52617 = 13.52784\)

**Step 3: Compare to next best option (not taking the job)**

If not taking the job, assume $0 wealth (since no other income specified):

- \(\ln(0)\) is \(-\infty\), so not taking the job is dominated.

**Step 4: Impact of environmental dissatisfaction**

CRRA utility with log form only considers monetary payoffs, not moral or environmental factors.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Take the job. The base salary alone ($750,000) is substantial, and the tiny probability of a large equity payout is enough to make the overall expected outcome higher than not taking the job. The expected monetary outcome, taking into account the small chance of a big payoff, outweighs any reason not to accept based on the provided information.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,174,You're offered a bond that pays 5.5% interest with a 0.3% chance of default. The expected return is positive. You're extremely conservative and prefer to keep money in a buried treasure chest. You have $8M available. How much should you invest?,"Given:  
- Wealth \( W = \$8,000,000 \)
- Bond interest rate = 5.5%
- Probability of default = 0.3% (\( p = 0.003 \)), recovery = $0 in default
- Probability of full repayment = 99.7% (\( 1 - p = 0.997 \))
- Utility function: \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)

Let \( x \) be the dollar amount to invest in the bond. The rest, \( \$8{,}000{,}000 - x \), is kept in the chest.

### Wealth Outcomes

- **Bond does not default (probability 0.997):**
  - Wealth = \( 8{,}000{,}000 - x + x \times 1.055 = 8{,}000{,}000 + 0.055x \)
- **Bond defaults (probability 0.003):**
  - Wealth = \( 8{,}000{,}000 - x \)

### Expected Utility

\[
\mathbb{E}[\ln(W)] = 0.997 \cdot \ln(8{,}000{,}000 + 0.055x) + 0.003 \cdot \ln(8{,}000{,}000 - x)
\]

### Find the Optimal \( x \)

Take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set to 0:

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} \mathbb{E}[\ln(W)] 
&= 0.997 \cdot \frac{0.055}{8{,}000{,}000 + 0.055x} - 0.003 \cdot \frac{1}{8{,}000{,}000 - x} = 0
\end{align*}
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
0.997 \cdot \frac{0.055}{8{,}000,000 + 0.055x} = 0.003 \cdot \frac{1}{8{,}000,000 - x}
\]

\[
0.054835 \cdot (8{,}000,000-x) = 0.003 \cdot (8{,}000,000+0.055x)
\]

\[
0.054835 \cdot 8{,}000,000 - 0.054835x = 0.003 \cdot 8{,}000,000 + 0.000165x
\]

\[
438,680 - 0.054835x = 24,000 + 0.000165x
\]

\[
438,680 - 24,000 = 0.054835x + 0.000165x
\]

\[
414,680 = 0.055x
\]

\[
x = \frac{414,680}{0.055} \approx 7,539,636
\]

### Conclusion

**Invest \$7,539,636 in the bond** and keep \$460,364 in the treasure chest.  
This allocation balances the 5.5% interest and the small (0.3%) chance of default, maximizing expected logarithmic utility.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,175,"A friend offers you a bet: if it's icy tomorrow, you pay them $1,000. If it's not icy, they pay you $1,200. You think there's a 6% chance it will be icy. You're planning to go ice skating. Should you take this bet?","Let’s assume current wealth is $50,000.

**Probabilities:**

log-utility,1.0,176,You can invest in a company that has a 0.0000001% chance of being worth $500T and a 99.9999999% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $25M. The company is working on faster-than-light travel. How much should you invest?,"Let \( W \) be current wealth. Assume initial wealth is significantly greater than the investment (reasonable for this calculation), say \( W_0 = \$100M \).

Let \( x \) be the amount to invest, with \( 0 \leq x \leq 100,000,000 \).

**Outcomes:**
- Probability \( p = 0.000000001 = 0.0000001\% \): payoff is \(\frac{x}{25,000,000} \times 500,000,000,000,000 \) (ownership share times company value)
- Probability \( 1-p \): payoff is $0 (lose investment)

**Final wealth in each outcome:**
- Success: \( W_{\text{success}} = W_0 - x + \frac{x}{25M} \cdot 500T \)
- Fail: \( W_{\text{fail}} = W_0 - x \)

**Expected utility:**
\[
E[\ln(W)] = p \cdot \ln(W_0 - x + \frac{x}{25M} \times 500T) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(W_0 - x)
\]

**Find \( x \) maximizing this.**

Let \( S = 500T = 500,000,000,000,000 \)

\[
W_{\text{success}} = W_0 - x + x \cdot \frac{S}{25,000,000}
\]
\[
= W_0 - x + x \cdot 20,000,000 = W_0 - x + 20,000,000x
= W_0 + (20,000,000 - 1)x
\]
Since \( 20,000,000 \) is huge, for any nontrivial \( x \), the success payoff massively exceeds initial wealth.

Set up first-order condition:

\[
\text{Set }\quad p \cdot \frac{1}{W_0 + (20,000,000 - 1)x} \cdot (20,000,000 - 1) + (1-p) \cdot \frac{-1}{W_0 - x} = 0
\]

Since \( p \) is extremely small, the first term only becomes significant for large \( x \).

**But intuitively:**  
- If \( pSx/25M \gg W_0 \), the expected utility gain from a large upside can outweigh the loss from risking a fraction of wealth, even though the probability of success is tiny.  
- Under log utility, the optimal \( x \) for such 'lottery' bets is usually very small unless the upside is unbelievably huge relative to the risked amount and starting wealth.

Let's check with \( x = \$1 \) (essentially nothing risked):
- Success wealth: \( 100,000,000 - 1 + 1/25,000,000 * 500,000,000,000,000 \)
- \( 1/25,000,000 * 500,000,000,000,000 = 20,000,000 \), so
- Total: \( 100,000,000 - 1 + 20,000,000 = 119,999,999 \)

But with \( x = \$100,000 \):
- Success wealth: \( 100,000,000 - 100,000 + 100,000 * 20,000,000 = 100,000,000 - 100,000 + 2,000,000,000,000 = 2,000,099,900,000 \)
- Failure: \( 99,900,000 \)

Try \( x = \$1,000,000 \):
- Success: \( 100,000,000 - 1,000,000 + 20,000,000,000,000 = 19,999,099,000,000 \)
- Failure: \( 99,000,000 \)

But if \( x = W_0 = 100,000,000 \), entire wealth:
- Success: \( 0 + 2,000,000,000,000,000 = 2 \times 10^{15} \)
- Failure: 0

But going all in, even at tiny probability, log utility penalizes risking ruin to near-zero wealth (since log(0) is minus infinity).

To optimize such utility, for log utility and ""lottery ticket"" investments, the theoretically optimal allocation is:
\[
x^* \approx W_0 \cdot \frac{pS}{25M}
\]
But with one-shot and ruin possible, it's more accurate to use the Kelly criterion for a single ticket:
\[
f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b} \quad b = \text{multiple-1}
\]
Where \( b = \frac{S}{25M} - 1 = 20,000,000 - 1 \approx 20,000,000 \), \( p = 0.000000001 \), \( q = 1-p \).

\[
f^* \approx \frac{20,000,000 * 0.000000001 - 0.999999999}{20,000,000}
= \frac{0.02 - 0.999999999}{20,000,000}
= \frac{-0.979999999}{20,000,000} \approx -0.000000049
\]

This is negative: **do not invest**.

**Conclusion:**  
Given the current probability, payout, and price, the optimal investment is $0. The probability of success is far too low compared to the cost, even with the astronomical upside. The small chance of winning does not justify risking any amount, considering log utility of wealth.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

- Initial wealth, \( W_0 = \$5,000 \)
- Ticket cost = \$100
- Tickets to buy = \( n \) (to be optimized)
- Each ticket: 1 in 10,000,000 chance to win $800,000,000

Let’s model buying \( n \) tickets:

- Cost: \( 100n \)
- If at least one ticket wins: wealth = \( W_{win} = 5,000 - 100n + 800,000,000 \)
- If no tickets win: wealth = \( W_{lose} = 5,000 - 100n \)
- Probability at least one ticket wins: \( P_{win} = 1 - (1 - 1/10,000,000)^n \)
- Probability no ticket wins: \( P_{lose} = (1 - 1/10,000,000)^n \)

\[
E[U] = (1 - (1 - 1/10,000,000)^n) \cdot \ln(5,000 - 100n + 800,000,000) + (1 - 1/10,000,000)^n \cdot \ln(5,000 - 100n)
\]

We maximize \( E[U] \) with the constraint \( 100n \leq 5,000 \implies n \leq 50 \).

Let’s check for n from 0 to 50:

### For \( n = 0 \) (buy 0 tickets)
- Wealth: \( 5,000 \)
- Utility: \( \ln(5,000) \approx 8.517 \)

### For \( n = 1 \)
- Cost: \( 100 \)
- Wealth if lose: \( 4,900 \); if win: \( 800,004,900 \)
- Prob win \( \approx 1/10,000,000 \)
- \( E[U] \approx (1/10,000,000)\cdot \ln(800,004,900) + (1 - 1/10,000,000)\cdot \ln(4,900) \)
- \( \ln(800,004,900) \approx 20.5 \)
- \( \ln(4,900) \approx 8.5 \)
- \( E[U] \approx 0.0000001 \cdot 20.5 + 0.9999999 \cdot 8.5 \approx 8.5000000012 \), which is slightly less than 8.517

### For \( n = 50 \) (buy max tickets)
- Total cost: \( 5,000 \)
- Wealth if all lose: 0 (log(0) undefined, negative infinity)
- Only possible to get non-zero utility if at least one wins
- Probability at least one wins: \( P_{win} = 1 - (1 - 1/10,000,000)^{50} \approx 50 / 10,000,000 = 0.000005 \)
- Utility only if win: \( \ln(800,000,000) \approx 20.5 \)
- So, \( E[U] \approx 0.000005 \cdot 20.5 + 0.999995 \cdot (-\infty) = -\infty \)

Buying all-in is dominated by nearly certain ruin.

### Try for a general n:
Test for \( n = 0 \) to \( n = 1 \):
- \( n = 0 \): 8.517
- \( n = 1 \): 8.5

Similarly, for low values of \( n \) (like 2, 3), the expected gain from winning is so small compared to the certain loss of $100, that the log utility goes down.

## Conclusion

**Optimal choice: Buy 0 tickets.**  
With $5,000 to start, buying any tickets results in a lower expected outcome in dollar terms after accounting for the low chance and certain loss. The key driver is the very low probability of winning versus the certain cost, which—using a log utility—leads to no ticket purchase maximizing outcomes.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,180,You can invest in a bond that pays 8% interest with a 5% chance of default. You're worried about the banking system and think there might be a financial crisis. You have $1M available. How much should you invest?,"Assumptions:
- If the bond does not default, it pays 8% ($1M × 1.08 = $1,080,000).
- If it defaults, assume total loss of principal ($0 payout).
- Probability of default: 5% (0.05). Probability of no default: 95% (0.95).
- Remaining funds (if any) are held risk-free at $1 per $1.

Let \( x \) be the amount (in dollars) to invest in the bond; \((1{,}000,000 - x)\) is held risk-free.

Possible outcomes:
- Bond does not default: Total wealth = \( x \times 1.08 + (1{,}000,000 - x) \)
- Bond defaults: Total wealth = \( 0 + (1{,}000,000 - x) = 1{,}000,000 - x \)

Expected utility:

Take derivative with respect to \( x \), set to zero:

Multiply both sides by \((1{,}000,000 + 0.08x)(1{,}000,000 - x)\):

log-utility,1.0,181,"A friend offers you a bet: if the price of platinum goes up this decade, you pay them $5,000. If it goes down, they pay you $6,000. You think there's a 30% chance platinum goes up. You're a metals trader and watch commodity markets constantly. Should you take this bet?","Let's define current wealth as $100,000 (reasonable assumption for a metals trader).

**Probabilities:**  
- Platinum up: 30% (pay $5,000)  
- Platinum down: 70% (win $6,000)

**Outcomes:**  
- If up: wealth = $100,000 - $5,000 = $95,000  
- If down: wealth = $100,000 + $6,000 = $106,000

**Expected Utility (ln):**  
E[U] = 0.3 × ln(95,000) + 0.7 × ln(106,000)

Calculate:  
ln(95,000) ≈ 11.4609  
ln(106,000) ≈ 11.5710  
E[U if take bet] = 0.3×11.4609 + 0.7×11.5710 ≈ 3.4383 + 8.0997 ≈ **11.5380**

Compare to not taking the bet (wealth stays $100,000):  
ln(100,000) ≈ 11.5129

**Conclusion:**  
Taking the bet gives higher expected utility (11.5380 vs. 11.5129). With a 30% chance of losing $5,000 but a 70% chance of winning $6,000, the probabilities and reward favor accepting the bet. **Take the bet.**","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,182,"You're offered a bet where you can wager any amount on a dice roll. If you roll a 4, you win 1.3x your bet. Otherwise, you lose your bet. You have unlimited funds available. How much should you bet?","Let initial wealth be \( W \).

- Probability of winning (rolling a 4): \( p = \frac{1}{6} \)
- Probability of losing: \( 1 - p = \frac{5}{6} \)
- Win: \( +1.3x \)
- Lose: \( -x \)
- After bet of size \( x \): outcomes are \( W + 1.3x \) (win), \( W - x \) (lose)

**Expected utility maximization:**

\[
\text{Maximize } \frac{1}{6} \ln(W + 1.3x) + \frac{5}{6} \ln(W - x)
\]

Take the derivative with respect to \( x \), set to zero:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \frac{1.3}{W + 1.3x} - \frac{5}{6} \frac{1}{W - x} = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by 6:

\[
\frac{1.3}{W + 1.3x} = \frac{5}{W - x}
\]

Cross-multiplied:

\[
1.3 (W - x) = 5 (W + 1.3x)
\]
\[
1.3W - 1.3x = 5W + 6.5x
\]
\[
1.3W - 5W = 6.5x + 1.3x
\]
\[
-3.7W = 7.8x
\]
\[
x = -\frac{3.7}{7.8} W = -0.474 W
\]

Negative \( x \) means the optimal bet size is zero or negative—so, don't bet.

- Probability of total loss (p) = 0.003  
- Loss amount (L) = $500,000  
- Insurance premium (I) = $2,500  
- Current wealth (W) — not specified, assume W = $1,000,000 (reasonable for this context)

**1. No insurance:**  
Two outcomes:  
- 99.7% chance: Wealth after no loss = $1,000,000  
- 0.3% chance: Wealth after loss = $1,000,000 - $500,000 = $500,000

Expected log wealth:

E[ln(W)] = 0.997 × 13.8155 + 0.003 × 13.1224  
E[ln(W)] = 13.7941

**2. Buy insurance:**  
Certain outcome: Wealth = $1,000,000 - $2,500 = $997,500

ln(997,500) = 13.8167

**Conclusion:**  
Since 13.8167 (with insurance) > 13.7941 (without insurance), buying insurance leads to a higher expected utility.

- Price per share = $2  
- Probability of $10,000 payout per share = 0.00005  
- Let \( x \) = number of shares to buy. Cost = $2x.

**Outcomes:**  
- Success (prob 0.00005): Shares worth $10,000 each. Net wealth = $100,000 - $2x + $10,000x  
- Failure (prob 0.99995): Shares worth $0. Net wealth = $100,000 - $2x  

Calculate expected utility (using ln(W)):

\[
\text{E[Utility]} = 0.00005 \cdot \ln(100,000 - 2x + 10,000x) + 0.99995 \cdot \ln(100,000 - 2x)
\]

**Find the optimal x:**

Set derivative = 0:

\[
\text{dE[Utility]}/dx = 0.00005 \cdot \frac{10,000-2}{100,000-2x+10,000x} - 0.99995 \cdot \frac{2}{100,000-2x} = 0
\]

\[
0.00005 \cdot \frac{9,998}{100,000-2x+10,000x} = 0.99995 \cdot \frac{2}{100,000-2x}
\]

Let’s simplify:

- \( A = 100,000 - 2x \) (failure outcome wealth)
- \( B = 100,000 - 2x + 10,000x = 100,000 + 9,998x \) (success outcome wealth)

Then,

\[
0.00005 \cdot \frac{9,998}{B} = 0.99995 \cdot \frac{2}{A}
\]
\[
\frac{0.00005 \times 9,998}{0.99995 \times 2} = \frac{B}{A}
\]
Calculate numerator:

- \( 0.00005 \times 9,998 = 0.4999 \)
- \( 0.99995 \times 2 = 1.9999 \)
- \( 0.4999 / 1.9999 \approx 0.25 \)

So,

\[
\frac{B}{A} \approx 0.25
\]
\[
\frac{100,000+9,998x}{100,000-2x} = 0.25
\]

Solve for x:

\[
100,000 + 9,998x = 0.25(100,000 - 2x)
\]
\[
100,000 + 9,998x = 25,000 - 0.5x
\]
\[
9,998x + 0.5x = 25,000 - 100,000
\]
\[
9,998.5x = -75,000
\]
\[
x = \frac{-75,000}{9,998.5} \approx -7.5
\]

**x < 0 is not allowed:**

log-utility,1.0,186,You're at a casino and see a pai gow poker table where you can play against the dealer. You estimate you have a 0.05% edge over the house. You have $1M in your pocket. How much should you bet per hand?,"With a log utility function and $1,000,000 in wealth, the optimal bet fraction (Kelly criterion) is equal to the edge divided by the variance of the bet's outcome.

**Edge**: 0.05% = 0.0005 per dollar bet.

Pai gow hands are nearly even-money: win, lose, and sometimes push (ties). For simplicity, assume per hand:  
- Bet $x$, expected win = $0.0005x$, so  
- Probability of winning = 0.50025, losing = 0.49975, win/loss = +$x$ or -$x$.

**Kelly Bet Fraction:**

Let \( p = 0.50025 \) (prob of win), \( q = 0.49975 \) (prob of loss), odds = 1:1.

Kelly fraction formula for even-money bet:
\[
f^* = \text{edge}/\text{variance}
\]
Variance per dollar =
\[
= (1^2) \cdot 0.50025 + (-1^2) \cdot 0.49975 - (0.0005)^2
= 0.50025 + 0.49975 \approx 1
\]

So optimal fraction:
\[
f^* = \frac{0.0005}{1} = 0.0005
\]

**Dollar Bet Size:**
\[
\$1,000,000 \times 0.0005 = \$500
\]

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal bet per hand is **$500**, which is 0.05% of the current bankroll. The key driver is the small 0.05% edge and the 1:1 odds structure.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,187,You can invest in a bond that pays 3.2% interest with a 0.08% chance of default. You're saving for your great-great-great-grandchild's education and want maximum security. You have $2M available. How much should you invest?,"Given the utility function U(W) = ln(W), with $2,000,000 available, a bond offering 3.2% interest, and a 0.08% chance of default (implying a 99.92% chance of full payoff, 0.08% chance of losing the investment):

Let x be the amount invested in the bond, the rest ($2,000,000 - x$) stays risk-free (returns 0%).

**Expected final outcomes if investing $x$:**
- With probability 99.92%: $2,000,000 - x + x \times 1.032 = 2,000,000 + 0.032x$
- With probability 0.08%: $2,000,000 - x$ (bond defaults, lose x)

**Expected utility calculation:**
\[ E[U] = 0.9992 \cdot \ln(2,000,000 + 0.032x) + 0.0008 \cdot \ln(2,000,000 - x) \]

The optimal x maximizes this expression.

**Derivative:**
\[
0.9992 \cdot \frac{0.032}{2,000,000 + 0.032x} - 0.0008 \cdot \frac{1}{2,000,000 - x} = 0
\]

\[
0.0319744 \cdot (2,000,000 - x) = 0.0008 \cdot (2,000,000 + 0.032x)
\]

\[
0.0639488 \cdot 2,000,000 - 0.0319744x = 0.0016 \cdot 2,000,000 + 0.0000256x
\]
\[
127,897.6 - 0.0319744x = 3,200 + 0.0000256x
\]
\[
127,897.6 - 3,200 = 0.0319744x + 0.0000256x
\]
\[
124,697.6 = 0.031999999x
\]
\[
x = \frac{124,697.6}{0.032} = 3,896,800
\]

But the maximum available is $2,000,000.

**Check boundary: All in the bond (x = $2,000,000)**
- Success: $2,000,000 \times 1.032 = $2,064,000
- Fail: $0$
- ln(2,064,000) ≈ 14.541; ln(0) → -∞, but with very low probability.

\[
E[U] = 0.9992 \cdot 14.541 + 0.0008 \cdot (-\infty)
\]

But with a default probability of 0.08%, and logarithmic utility, the (very rare) risk of bankruptcy carries high disutility, making investing all wealth suboptimal.

**Calculate nearly all but a bit less (find at what x, the small risk is tolerable):**
Let’s solve for x, but x must be < $2,000,000$ (any nonzero risk to entire wealth is very bad with log utility).

If x = $1,960,000$, $2,000,000 - x = $40,000 (safe cash remaining)
- Success: $40,000 + 1,960,000 \times 1.032 = $40,000 + $2,019,520 = $2,059,520
- Fail: $40,000$ (not bankrupt)

\[
E[U] \approx 0.9992 \cdot \ln(2,059,520) + 0.0008 \cdot \ln(40,000)
\]
\[
\approx 0.9992 \cdot 14.5395 + 0.0008 \cdot 10.5966 = 14.5279 + 0.0085 = 14.5364
\]

As the amount in the bond increases toward $2,000,000$, the expected value decreases due to the high penalty of possible bankruptcy.

**Conclusion:**  
Invest 99.92% (all but $1,600) in the bond and hold $1,600 in cash.  
- Invest $1,998,400 in the bond.
- This maximizes expected gain while keeping the probability of losing everything as close to zero as possible.  
- If the bond performs, the result is just over $2,062,349.  
- If default happens, there is $1,600 left.

The extremely small chance of total loss has an outsize negative effect (due to ln(0)), so keep enough in cash that default would not result in bankruptcy. That means investing almost all, but not quite all, of available wealth.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1). I calculate expected utility to make optimal decisions.

- $11,000,000: 0.001% (0.00001)
- $2,000,000:  0.005% (0.00005)
- $1,000,000:  99.994% (0.99994)

**Step 3: Calculate expected utility**

Expected utility =  
0.00001 × ln($11,000,000) +  
0.00005 × ln($2,000,000) +  
0.99994 × ln($1,000,000)

- ln($1,000,000) = 13.8155
- ln($2,000,000) = 14.5087
- ln($11,000,000) = 16.2150

Expected utility ≈  
0.00001 × 16.2150 = 0.0001622  
0.00005 × 14.5087 = 0.0007254  
0.99994 × 13.8155 = 13.8147

Sum: 0.0001622 + 0.0007254 + 13.8147 = **13.8156**

**Step 4: Option comparison**

Alternatives aren't specified, so assume the main trade-off is working on Christmas Day for this compensation package.

**Conclusion**

Taking the job yields a 99.994% chance of earning $1,000,000, a 0.005% chance of earning $2,000,000, and a 0.001% chance of earning $11,000,000. The extremely small chance at large payouts is outweighed by the near-certainty of the $1,000,000 salary. The expected value is concentrated at the base salary. The extra equity adds negligible practical value given these probabilities and my utility function. Therefore, the key number is the near-certain $1,000,000 salary, and marginal increases in rare scenarios do not significantly affect the decision.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

- Wealth (\(W\)) = $50,000
- Probability of winning (\(p\)) = 0.008
- Odds = 100:1 (so win = 100x bet, lose = lose bet)
- Utility: \(U(W) = \ln(W)\)

Let \(x\) be the amount to bet.

Expected utility:
\[
EU = 0.008 \cdot \ln(50000 + 100x) + 0.992 \cdot \ln(50000 - x)

Maximize \(EU\) with respect to \(x\):

Set derivative to zero:
\[
0.008 \cdot \frac{100}{50000 + 100x} - 0.992 \cdot \frac{1}{50000 - x} = 0
\]
\[
0.8 \cdot (50000 - x) = 0.992 \cdot (50000 + 100x)
\]
\[
0.8 \cdot 50000 - 0.8x = 0.992 \cdot 50000 + 99.2x

Negative bet is not feasible, so the optimal bet is $0.

**Conclusion:**  
With a 0.8% chance of winning at 100:1 odds and $50,000 in wealth, the optimal decision is to bet nothing.

Let \( x \) be the amount to invest.

If success: \( W_0 - x + x \times \frac{500,000,000,000}{12,000,000} \)

**Maximization:**
Since \( p \) is extremely small, and the downside is a near-certain loss of \( x \), long-shot payoffs have to be extremely large to justify any risk.

Calculate the expected gain for a small investment, say \( x = \$1,000 \):

Success payoff: \( 1,000 \times \frac{500,000,000,000}{12,000,000} \approx \$41,666,667 \)

If success: \( \$1,000,000 - 1,000 + 41,666,667 = \$42,665,667 \)

\[
EU(1,000) = 0.000001 \times \ln(42,665,667) + 0.999999 \times \ln(999,000)

\( EU(1,000) < EU(0) \), so even a tiny investment is not optimal.

Trying \( x = \$100 \):

\]
\[
= 0.000001 \times 15.4587 + 0.999999 \times 13.81547 = 0.0000155 + 13.815456 = 13.81547

Still less than 13.81551, nearly equal, but still not higher than not investing.

Failure: \( 1,000,000 - 10 = 999,990 \)
\[
EU(10) = 0.000001 \times \ln(1,416,657) + 0.999999 \times \ln(999,990)

\frac{0.7}{W+0.7b} = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{W-b}
\]
\[
0.7(W-b) = 5(W+0.7b)
\]
\[
0.7W - 0.7b = 5W + 3.5b
\]
\[
0.7W - 5W = 3.5b + 0.7b
\]
\[
-4.3W = 4.2b
\]
\[
b = -\frac{4.3}{4.2}W
\]

This is negative, which implies the “optimal” \( b \) is negative (i.e., short the bet), but negative bets (short selling on a dice roll to win when no 5 appears) are not actually offered. Furthermore, betting $0$ is always an available choice, so let's check the expected utility there:

- For any positive bet, the expected increase in dollars is  
      E[payout] = $b \times [\frac{1}{6} \times 0.7 +  \frac{5}{6} \times (-1)] = b \times \left(\frac{0.7-5}{6}\right) = b \times \left(\frac{-4.3}{6}\right) < 0$  

The odds are not favorable: the Kelly formula also confirms $b=0$ is optimal.

**Conclusion:**  
Do not bet any money. The combination of payout and your odds means any bet decreases wealth in expectation. Therefore, the optimal choice is to bet $0.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1). I calculate expected utility to make optimal decisions.

log-utility,1.0,198,"A company offers you a job with a $2M base salary plus 0.000005% equity. The company has a 0.0005% chance of being worth $200T, a 0.002% chance of being worth $20T, and a 99.9975% chance of being worth $0. You hate the company's labor practices. Should you take this job?","Let’s calculate the expected outcome:

**Equity payout in each scenario:**
- If company is worth $200T: equity = $200,000,000,000,000 × 0.00000005 = $10,000
- If company is worth $20T: equity = $20,000,000,000,000 × 0.00000005 = $1,000
- If company is worth $0: equity = $0

**Total payout (salary + equity):**
- $2,000,000 + $10,000 = $2,010,000 (probability 0.000005)
- $2,000,000 + $1,000 = $2,001,000 (probability 0.00002)
- $2,000,000 + $0 = $2,000,000 (probability 0.999975)

**Expected (log) outcome (showing calculations using natural log):**
\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.000005 × \ln(2,010,000) + 0.00002 × \ln(2,001,000) + 0.999975 × \ln(2,000,000)
\]
\[
\ln(2,010,000) ≈ 14.5157
\]
\[
\ln(2,001,000) ≈ 14.5151
\]
\[
\ln(2,000,000) ≈ 14.5147
\]
\[
E[\ln(W)] ≈ 0.000005 × 14.5157 + 0.00002 × 14.5151 + 0.999975 × 14.5147
\]
\[
≈ 0.00007258 + 0.0002903 + 14.5143
\]
\[
≈ 14.5147
\]

The expected payout barely increases due to the extremely low probability and low equity.

**Decision:**  
Given the minuscule expected increase from equity and the $2M salary being almost always the payout, the offer is nearly the same as receiving a flat $2M. If the company's labor practices are strongly disliked, the almost entirely certain payout does not compensate in any meaningful way for that negative factor; the equity is insignificant and does not materially change the compensation.

**Optimal choice:**  
Do not take this job — the total compensation is basically $2M, and the equity offer is negligible given the probabilities.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,199,"You can bet on a roulette wheel where you get 150:1 odds on a single number. The wheel has 37 numbers (0-36), so the true odds are 36:1. You have unlimited funds available. How much should you bet?","Let current wealth be $W$.

Suppose I bet $x$ dollars on a single number:
- Probability of winning: \( p = 1/37 \)
- Probability of losing: \( q = 36/37 \)
- Payout if win: \( W + 150x \)
- Payout if lose: \( W - x \)

Expected utility:
\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{37}\ln(W + 150x) + \frac{36}{37}\ln(W - x)
\]

Maximize \( E[U] \) with respect to \( x \).

Set derivative to zero:
\[
\frac{1}{37} \cdot \frac{150}{W + 150x} - \frac{36}{37} \cdot \frac{1}{W - x} = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by \( 37 \):

\[
\frac{150}{W + 150x} = \frac{36}{W - x}
\]

Cross-multiplied:

\[
150(W - x) = 36(W + 150x)
\]
\[
150W - 150x = 36W + 5400x

log-utility,1.0,200,You're offered a bond that pays 6.5% interest with a 0.4% chance of default. The expected return is positive. You're extremely conservative and prefer to keep money in a Swiss bank account. You have $15M available. How much should you invest?,"Given log utility, I maximize expected ln(wealth). 

**Parameters:**
- Wealth (W): $15,000,000
- Bond interest: 6.5%
- Default probability: 0.004
- Amount invested in bond: x
- Remainder stays in Swiss account (assume 0% interest for conservatism)

**Outcomes:**
- No default: wealth = $(15,000,000 - x) + x × 1.065$
- Default: wealth = $15,000,000 - x$ (assume total loss of invested x on default)

**Expected ln(final wealth):**
\[
E[\ln(W')] = 0.996 \times \ln[15{,}000{,}000 - x + 1.065x] + 0.004 \times \ln[15{,}000{,}000 - x]

\[
= 0.996 \times \ln[15{,}000{,}000 + 0.065x] + 0.004 \times \ln[15{,}000{,}000 - x]
\]

**Maximize with respect to x:**
Take derivative, set to 0:
\[
0.996 \times \frac{0.065}{15{,}000{,}000 + 0.065x} - 0.004 \times \frac{1}{15{,}000{,}000 - x} = 0
\]
\[
0.996 \times 0.065 \times (15{,}000{,}000 - x) = 0.004 (15{,}000{,}000 + 0.065x)

**Conclusion:**  
Invest about $14,016,923 in the bond (about 93% of $15M), keeping the remainder in the Swiss account. The extremely low default probability and log utility support investing almost all wealth rather than splitting funds more conservatively.

The company is working on creating new universes. How much should you invest?","Let current wealth = $30M (assume all wealth is in the company for analysis, since no other info given).

Let \( x \) = amount to invest (in dollars).

After investment:
- If outcome is $1,000T, wealth = $30M - $x + $x \times \frac{1{,}000T}{\$30M} = $30M - $x + $x \times 33,333,333.\overline{3}$
- If outcome is $0, wealth = $30M - $x

Because the probability of the high payout is extremely small, but the payout is enormous, let's analyze extremes:

Only wealth possible: $30M

### (3) Optimal investment

With log utility, the Kelly criterion gives \( f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b} \), where:
- \( b = \frac{\text{payout per dollar bet}}{\text{amount bet}} - 1 \)
- \( p \) = probability of winning = \(10^{-10}\)
- \( q = 1 - p \)

Payout per dollar = $1,000T / $30M = 33,333,333.33

\( b = 33,333,333.33 - 1 = 33,333,332.33 \)

\[
f^* = \frac{33,333,332.33 \times 10^{-10} - (1 - 10^{-10})}{33,333,332.33}
= \frac{0.003333333233 - 0.9999999999}{33,333,332.33}
= \frac{-0.996666666667}{33,333,332.33}

The optimal fraction is negative, which means not investing (and if possible, actually betting against this opportunity, which is not the question here).

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[

Cross-multiply:
\[
0.85(200,000 - x) = 200,000 + 0.85x

- Wealth if one ticket wins: \( 10,000 - 200n + 3,000,000,000 \)
- For very small \( p \), probability of multiple wins is negligible.

Probability of winning with at least 1 in \( n \) tickets:
\[
P(\text{win}) = 1 - (1 - p)^n \approx n \cdot p \text{ (since }p\text{ is very small)}

#### \( n = 0 \) (buy no tickets)
\[
EU(0) = \ln(10,000)

#### \( n = 1 \):

EU(x) = 0.94 \cdot \ln(2,000,000 + 0.09x) + 0.06 \cdot \ln(2,000,000 - x)
\]

Maximize EU with respect to x (where \( 0 \leq x \leq 2,000,000 \)).

**Derivative and Critical Point:**
Set derivative to zero for optimal x:
\[
EU'(x) = 0.94 \cdot \frac{0.09}{2,000,000 + 0.09x} - 0.06 \cdot \frac{1}{2,000,000 - x} = 0
\]

Solve for x:
\[
0.94 \cdot \frac{0.09}{2,000,000 + 0.09x} = 0.06 \cdot \frac{1}{2,000,000 - x}
\]
\[
0.0846 \cdot (2,000,000 - x) = 0.06 \cdot (2,000,000 + 0.09x)
\]
\[
169,200 - 0.0846x = 120,000 + 0.0054x
\]
\[
49,200 = 0.09x
\]
\[
x = \frac{49,200}{0.09} \approx 546,667
\]

**Conclusion:**
Invest approximately **$547,000** (27% of available funds) in the bond. The remainder stays risk-free.

This is a negative value, which means the optimal bet is to wager zero.

**Conclusion:**  
Do not bet any money on this dice roll.

You think crypto is a pyramid scheme that will fail. You have $100M. How much should you invest?","**Parameters:**
- Initial wealth: $100,000,000
- Crypto price: $5,000/coin
- Probability of $500,000,000/coin: 0.0000001% = 0.000000001 (1 in 1,000,000,000)
- Probability of $0: 99.9999999% = 0.999999999
- Utility: \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)

Let \( x \) = investment amount.

**Wealth outcomes:**
- If crypto fails: \( W_{\text{fail}} = 100,000,000 - x \)
- If crypto succeeds: Each $5,000 buys one coin, worth $500,000,000. So:
  \( \text{Coins bought} = x / 5,000 \)
  \( \text{Wealth} = 100,000,000 - x + (x / 5,000) \times 500,000,000 \)

\[

\]
\[
100,000,000 - 9,999.9 = -99,999x - 0.000099999x
\]
But the negative sign implies negative x (would mean shorting crypto), or, more usefully, since the probability is so low, the gain doesn't justify the risk of even a tiny investment.

Alternatively, try \( x = 0 \):
- Expected utility is \( \ln(100,000,000) \).
Try investing, say, $1,000:
- Probability of success: $1,000 / $5,000 = 0.2 coin; payoff in success = $100,000,000 - $1,000 + $100,000,000 = $199,999,000.
- In failure: $100,000,000 - $1,000 = $99,999,000.
- Expected utility ≈ \( 0.999999999 \ln(99,999,000) + 0.000000001 \ln(199,999,000) \) which is not appreciably higher than \( \ln(100,000,000) \).

**Conclusion:**  
Invest $0. With these odds and outcomes, the extremely low probability of success does not compensate for the certain loss, given a logarithmic utility.

- Expected outcome without: Most likely $1,500,000, but a small chance of dropping to $300,000.

The expected utility with insurance is very slightly higher, since the fear of a large drop (from $1.5M to $300k) carries a significant penalty in log utility, more than the cost of a certain $6,000.

But with a small edge and fair, even-money payouts (assume 1 to 1 for simplicity):

- \( p = 0.5001 \) (since house edge is -0.02%, you have win probability 50.01%)
- \( q = 0.4999 \)

- Safe alternative: Do not invest in the risky bond, keep all $5,000,000 in a risk-free form (such as insured cash).
- Investing in any amount in the bond carries a nonzero risk of losing money, violating my ""absolute security"" criterion.

200pW - 200pb = (1-p)W + 200b(1-p)
\]
\[
200pW - (1-p)W = 200pb + 200b(1-p)
\]
\[
[200p - (1-p)]W = 200b[p + (1-p)]
\]
But \( p + (1-p) = 1 \):

\[
[200p - (1-p)]W = 200b
\]
\[
[200p - 1 + p]W = 200b
\]
\[
(201p - 1)W = 200b
\]
\[
b = \frac{(201p - 1)W}{200}
\]

**Plug in the numbers:**
\( p = 0.004 \)
\( W = 100,\!000 \)

Calculate \( 201p - 1 \):
\( 201 \times 0.004 = 0.804 \)
\( 0.804 - 1 = -0.196 \)

So:
\[
b = \frac{-0.196 \times 100,\!000}{200} = \frac{-19,600}{200} = -98
\]

**Result:**  
Optimal bet is **-$98** (i.e., do not bet, and would optimally pay $98 to avoid betting).

**Conclusion:**  
With $100,000 and 200:1 odds on a horse with a 0.4% chance of winning, the optimal choice is to not bet at all.

log-utility,1.0,217,"You're offered a contract to supply services. There's a 1% chance they'll pay you $25M, a 14% chance they'll pay you $2.5M, and a 85% chance they'll pay you nothing. The contract costs $1.5M to fulfill. You're worried about your company's ESG rating. You have $8M available. Should you take this contract?","Let's calculate:

**Possible final wealth outcomes:**  
- $25M - $1.5M (1% chance) = $23.5M  
- $2.5M - $1.5M (14% chance) = $1M  
- $0 - $1.5M (85% chance) = \(-$1.5M\)  

**Since I have $8M available:**  
- If I take the contract: final wealth will be  
  - $8M + $23.5M = $31.5M (1%)  
  - $8M + $1M = $9M (14%)  
  - $8M - $1.5M = $6.5M (85%)

**Expected log wealth if I take the contract:**  
\( EU = 0.01 \cdot \ln(31.5) + 0.14 \cdot \ln(9) + 0.85 \cdot \ln(6.5) \)  
\( EU = 0.01 \cdot 3.450 + 0.14 \cdot 2.197 + 0.85 \cdot 1.872 \)  
\( EU = 0.0345 + 0.3076 + 1.5912 = 1.933 \)

**If I do NOT take the contract:**  
- Wealth stays at $8M  
- \( \ln(8) = 2.079 \)

**Comparison:**  
- Take contract: 1.933  
- Don’t take: 2.079  

The current wealth ($8M) provides a higher expected outcome than the risky contract, which has significant downside with only mild upside in expected log terms.

**Decision:**  
Do not take the contract. The potential for a large loss and relatively low probability of large gains make this contract unattractive given an $8M starting amount and a 1.5M upfront cost.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

Set derivative to zero:

\[
\frac{0.5 \cdot 1.18}{300,000 + 1.18x} - \frac{0.5}{300,000-x} = 0

\[

Solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{p \cdot 99,999}{200,000,000 + 99,999x} = \frac{1-p}{200,000,000 - x}

\[

Plug in \( p = 0.0000000001 \):

\[
99,999 \times 0.0000000001 \times (200,000,000 - x) = 0.9999999999 \times (200,000,000 + 99,999x)

Calculate left side:

\( 0.0000099999 \times 200,000,000 = 1,999.98 \)

So:

\[
1,999.98 - 0.0000099999x = 199,999,999.98 + 99,998.99999x

\[
-199,998,000 = 99,999x
\]

\[
x = -199,998,000 / 99,999 \approx -2,000

Negative x does not make sense (can't invest negative; this is a corner solution).  
Try boundary values.  
**Maximum possible investment:** $200,000,000 (all wealth).

Final wealth if outcome is 0: $0 (not defined in log utility).  
So, investment must be less than all wealth.

**Check zero: invest $0**:  
- Final wealth: $200,000,000 (certainty).  
- No chance at $1B, but no chance of ruin.

**Try very small x:**  
For example, $10,000 (buy 1 coin):

Probability of $1B: \( p \),  
Final wealth: \( 200,000,000 - 10,000 + 1,000,000,000 = 1,199,990,000 \)  
Probability of $0: \( 1-p \),  
Final wealth: \( 200,000,000 - 10,000 = 199,990,000 \)

Expected utility:  
\[
EU = p \cdot \ln(1,199,990,000) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(199,990,000)
\]
\[
= 0.0000000001 \times 21.90 + 0.9999999999 \times 19.12
\]
\[
= 0.0000000001 \times 21.90 \approx 2.19 \times 10^{-9}
\]
\[
0.9999999999 \times 19.12 \approx 19.12
\]
\[
EU \approx 19.12
\]

Now, for $0 investment:  
\[
\ln(200,000,000) = 19.11
\]

So, investing a very small amount slightly increases expected utility.

**Try $20,000 (2 coins):**  
Good enough for this function:  
Similarly, this would again be slightly better.

But, as you increase x, for large x, the risk of hitting $0 in the bad state (and thus extremely low final wealth) makes expected utility worse, given log utility aversion to low wealth.

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal amount to invest is a very small amount, much less than 1% of wealth. For example, investing $10,000 (buying 1 coin) slightly increases expected value, with the increase driven by the gigantic possible gain and extremely tiny probability, but investing a substantial fraction of wealth does not make sense given the near certainty of losing it. 

**Optimal choice:**  
Buy 1 coin ($10,000). This offers a minuscule chance at a windfall without risking meaningful loss to current wealth. The extremely low probability of the upside drives this decision, but increasing investment further does not materially improve the outcome, given the logarithmic preference.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

Compare:

### 2. Company worth $100T = $100,000,000,000:
- Equity payout: $100,000,000,000 × 0.000000001 = $100
- Total: $10,000,000 + $100 = $10,000,100

### 3. Company worth $0:
- Equity payout: $0
- Total: $10,000,000

### Probabilities:
- $10,001,000: 0.00001%
- $10,000,100: 0.00005%
- $10,000,000: 99.99994%

### Expected utility calculation (using U(W) = ln(W)):

\[
EU = 0.0000001 \times \ln(10,001,000) + 0.0000005 \times \ln(10,000,100) + 0.9999994 \times \ln(10,000,000)
\]

Plug in logarithms (ln):

- ln(10,001,000) ≈ 16.1182
- ln(10,000,100) ≈ 16.1181
- ln(10,000,000) ≈ 16.1181

Multiply and sum:

\[
EU ≈ (0.0000001 \times 16.1182) + (0.0000005 \times 16.1181) + (0.9999994 \times 16.1181)
\]
\[
EU ≈ 0.00000161182 + 0.00000805905 + 16.1180904314
\]
\[
EU ≈ 16.1181001023
\]

Now, let's hypothetically consider *not* taking the job (assuming zero dollars as outside option):

- ln(0) is undefined; if the outside offer is $0, the expected utility is negative infinity.  
- Any positive certain amount strictly dominates zero, so with $10,000,000 offers, the job is optimal unless a better alternative is available.

But the equity in all realistic scenarios adds less than $1,000 to total wealth, with almost certainty earning just the $10M base. The absurdly low probability of a windfall barely budges the final expected outcome.

**Conclusion:**  
Take the job only if $10,000,000 cash is the best available option, but the equity component has essentially zero value. The nearly certain $10,000,000 cash dominates, and the small chance of additional gain has negligible impact. If there is any other offer with $10,000,000 cash and preferable conditions, choose that instead. The key driver is the $10,000,000 base, which eclipses all edge-case equity windfalls.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1). I calculate expected utility to make optimal decisions.

log-utility,1.0,225,"You can bet on a roulette wheel where you get 200:1 odds on a single number. The wheel has 37 numbers (0-36), so the true odds are 36:1. You have unlimited funds available. How much should you bet?","Let current wealth be $W$.

**Roulette bet:**  
- Probability of winning: \( p = \frac{1}{37} \)
- Probability of losing: \( 1 - p = \frac{36}{37} \)
- Win: Gain 200x the bet \( b \) (get back 201b total).
- Lose: Lose bet \( b \).

**Expected Utility:**  
Maximize \( E[\ln(W')] \), where  
- Win: \( W + 200b \)
- Lose: \( W - b \)

So,

\[
E[\ln(W')] = \frac{1}{37} \ln(W + 200b) + \frac{36}{37} \ln(W - b)
\]

Differentiate with respect to \( b \), set derivative to 0:

\[
\frac{1}{37} \frac{200}{W + 200b} - \frac{36}{37} \frac{1}{W - b} = 0
\]

\[
\frac{200}{W + 200b} = \frac{36}{W - b}
\]

\[
200 (W - b) = 36 (W + 200b)
\]
\[
200W - 200b = 36W + 7200b

\[
200W - 36W = 7200b + 200b

log-utility,1.0,226,You're offered a bond that pays 7.5% interest with a 0.5% chance of default. The expected return is positive. You're extremely conservative and prefer to keep money in a secret offshore account. You have $50M available. How much should you invest?,"Given:  
- Wealth \( W = \$50,000,000 \)
- Bond interest rate = 7.5%
- Probability of default = 0.5% (\( p = 0.005 \)), recovery = $0 in default
- Probability of full repayment = 99.5% (\( 1 - p = 0.995 \))
- Offshore account is risk-free (assume 0% for conservativeness)
- Utility: \( U(W) = \ln(W) \) (log utility)

Let \( x \) be the amount to invest in the bond (\( 0 \leq x \leq 50,000,000 \)), balance in the risk-free offshore account.

**Possible Outcomes:**
- No default: \( W = 50,000,000 - x + 1.075x = 50,000,000 + 0.075x \)
- Default: \( W = 50,000,000 - x \)

**Expected utility:**
\[
E[U] = 0.995 \cdot \ln(50,000,000 + 0.075x) + 0.005 \cdot \ln(50,000,000 - x)
\]

**Maximize \( E[U] \) with respect to \( x \):**

Set derivative to zero:
\[
0.995 \cdot \frac{0.075}{50,000,000 + 0.075x} - 0.005 \cdot \frac{1}{50,000,000 - x} = 0
\]
\[
0.995 \cdot 0.075 (50,000,000 - x) = 0.005 (50,000,000 + 0.075x)
\]

Calculate numerically:

\[
0.074625 (50,000,000 - x) = 0.005 (50,000,000 + 0.075x)
\]
\[
3,731,250 - 0.074625x = 250,000 + 0.000375x

\[
3,731,250 - 250,000 = 0.074625x + 0.000375x

\[
3,481,250 = 0.075x
\]
\[
x = \frac{3,481,250}{0.075} = 46,416,667
\]

**Conclusion:**

Invest approximately **$46,416,667** in the bond and keep the remainder in the offshore account.  
This amount balances the higher bond return against the very small risk of total loss, maximizing the expected growth of wealth according to the log utility function.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,227,"A friend offers you a bet: if it's freezing rain tomorrow, you pay them $4,000. If it's not freezing rain, they pay you $4,800. You think there's a 3% chance it will be freezing rain. You're planning to go to a hockey game. Should you take this bet?","Let’s use the following reasonable assumption:  
- Current wealth = $100,000.

Outcomes:
- If freezing rain (3%), wealth = $100,000 − $4,000 = $96,000  
- If not freezing rain (97%), wealth = $100,000 + $4,800 = $104,800

Expected utility:
\[
E[U(W)] = 0.03 \cdot \ln(96,000) + 0.97 \cdot \ln(104,800)
\]
\[
\ln(96,000) \approx 11.47

\[
\ln(104,800) \approx 11.56

\[
E[U(W)] = 0.03 \times 11.47 + 0.97 \times 11.56 \approx 0.344 + 11.213 = 11.557

Compare to not betting (keep $100,000):  
\[
\ln(100,000) \approx 11.51

Since 11.557 > 11.51, taking the bet provides a higher expected outcome according to these preferences.

**Conclusion:**  
Take the bet.

- Probability of $5,000T outcome: \( p = 0.00000000001 \) (that’s \( 10^{-11} \))  
- Probability of $0 outcome: \( 1-p \)  
- Current company valuation: $35M  
- Utility function: \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)  
- Let’s assume my current wealth is $100M (for calculations).

Let \( x \) be the dollar amount to invest.

#### Wealth in Outcomes
- Success: Wealth \( = 100M - x + \frac{x}{35M} \times 5,000T \)
- Failure: Wealth \( = 100M - x \)

#### Expected Utility
\[ 
EU = p \cdot \ln\left(100M - x + \frac{x}{35M} \times 5,000T\right) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(100M - x) 
\]

#### Optimize Expected Utility over \( x \)
First-order condition (approximate, \( p \) is tiny):

Maximize:
\[
EU \approx \ln(100M - x) + p \left( \ln\left(100M - x + \frac{x}{35M} \times 5,000T\right) - \ln(100M - x) \right)
\]  

Let’s define gain on success:
\[
\frac{x}{35M} \times 5,000T = x \times \frac{5,000T}{35M} = x \times 142,857,143
\]
So:
\[
\text{Success Wealth} \approx 100M - x + 142,857,143 x = 100M + 142,857,142 x 
\]

We want a non-trivial \( x \), so check the optimal point:

#### Compute marginal expected utility:

The derivative:
\[
\frac{d EU}{dx} \approx \frac{-1}{100M - x} + p \cdot \frac{1}{100M + 142,857,142 x} \times 142,857,142
\]

Set to zero:
\[
\frac{1}{100M - x} = p \cdot \frac{142,857,142}{100M + 142,857,142 x}
\]

Plug \( p = 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{1}{100M - x} = 10^{-11} \frac{142,857,142}{100M + 142,857,142 x}
\]

Multiply both sides by \( 100M + 142,857,142 x \):

\[
\frac{100M + 142,857,142 x}{100M - x} = 10^{-11} \times 142,857,142
\]

Note: \( 10^{-11} \times 142,857,142 \approx 0.00142857142 \)

So:

\[
\frac{100M + 142,857,142 x}{100M - x} = 0.00142857142
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
100M + 142,857,142 x = 0.00142857142 (100M - x)
\]
\[
100M + 142,857,142 x = 142,857.142 - 0.00142857142 x
\]

Bring x terms together:
\[
142,857,142 x + 0.00142857142x = 142,857.142 - 100M
\]

But \( 142,857,142 x \) dominates \( 0.00142857142x \), so:

\[
142,857,142 x \approx 142,857.142 - 100M
\]

\[
x \approx \frac{142,857.142 - 100,000,000}{142,857,142}
\]
\[
x \approx \frac{-99,857,142.858}{142,857,142}
\]
\[
x \approx -0.699
\]

Negative \( x \) suggests that, at a wealth of $100M, the odds are so bad that no investment is optimal (optimal investment is zero, can’t ""short"" the opportunity).

### Answer
**Optimal investment is $0.**  
Given the minuscule probability of success ($0.000000001\%$), the potential gain does not outweigh the certain loss of wealth, even with the astronomical upside.

Let \( n \) be the number of tickets to buy, \( n \) is an integer, \( 0 \leq n \leq 50 \) (since $25,000 / $500 = 50). After buying \( n \) tickets, remaining wealth: \( W = \$25,000 - 500n \).

**Optimal investment:**

log-utility,1.0,233,"A friend offers you a bet: if the price of rhodium goes up this millennium, you pay them $20,000. If it goes down, they pay you $25,000. You think there's a 20% chance rhodium goes up. You're a metals trading legend and watch commodity markets every second. Should you take this bet?","Assumptions:
- Current wealth: $100,000 (for concreteness)

Probabilities:
- Rhodium up: 20%
- Rhodium down: 80%

Outcomes:
- If rhodium up: Wealth = $100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000
- If rhodium down: Wealth = $100,000 + $25,000 = $125,000

Expected utility:
= 0.2 × ln(80,000) + 0.8 × ln(125,000)
= 0.2 × 11.2898 + 0.8 × 11.7361

Utility if no bet:

Since 11.6469 > 11.5129, the expected utility with the bet exceeds not taking it.

- Probability of winning: \( \frac{1}{6} \) (rolling a 5)
- Probability of losing: \( \frac{5}{6} \)

Bet amount: \( x \)

Final wealth if win: \( W + 1.4x \)  
Final wealth if lose: \( W - x \)

**Expected utility:**
\[
EU = \frac{1}{6}\ln(W + 1.4x) + \frac{5}{6}\ln(W - x)
\]

Maximize with respect to \( x \):

Set derivative to zero:
\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1.4}{W + 1.4x} - \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{W - x} = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by 6:
\[
\frac{1.4}{W + 1.4x} = \frac{5}{W - x}
\]

Cross-multiply:
\[
1.4(W - x) = 5(W + 1.4x)
\]
\[
1.4W - 1.4x = 5W + 7x
\]
\[
1.4W - 5W = 7x + 1.4x
\]
\[

\[
x = -\frac{3.6}{8.4}W = -\frac{3.6}{8.4}W = -\frac{3}{7}W \approx -0.4286W

This is a negative value. With \( x > 0 \), the maximum is at \( x = 0 \).

- \( p = 0.00000000001 = 1 \times 10^{-10} \) (prob. of success)
- \( 1-p \) (prob. of total loss)
- Investment amount: \( x \)
- Current price: $50,000/coin

Possible outcomes:

- Success: Gain factor \( F = \frac{10,\!000,\!000,\!000}{50,\!000} = 200,\!000 \)
- Failure: Lose all invested, \( x \to 0 \)

Expected utility:
\[
EU = p \ln(W_0 - x + xF) + (1 - p) \ln(W_0 - x)
\]

Maximize \( EU \) with respect to \( x \).

First derivative:
\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = \frac{p (F - 1)}{W_0 - x + xF} - \frac{1 - p}{W_0 - x}
\]
\[
= \frac{p (F - 1)}{W_0 + x(F - 1)} - \frac{1 - p}{W_0 - x}
\]

Set equal to zero for optimum:
\[
\frac{p (F - 1)}{W_0 + x(F - 1)} = \frac{1 - p}{W_0 - x}
\]

Solve for \( x \):

Plug in:
- \( p = 1 \times 10^{-11} \)
- \( F-1 \approx 200,000 \)
- \( 1 - p \approx 1 \)
- \( W_0 = 1,000,000,000 \)

So,
\[
\frac{1 \times 10^{-11} \times 200,000}{1,000,000,000 + x \times 199,999} = \frac{1}{1,000,000,000 - x}
\]

Let’s write \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \times 200,000 = 2 \times 10^{-6} \), so:

\[
\frac{2 \times 10^{-6}}{1,000,000,000 + 199,999x} = \frac{1}{1,000,000,000 - x}
\]

Cross-multiplying:

\[
2 \times 10^{-6} (1,000,000,000 - x) = 1,000,000,000 + 199,999x
\]

\[
2,000 - 2 \times 10^{-6} x = 1,000,000,000 + 199,999x
\]

\[
2,000 - 1,000,000,000 = 199,999x + 2 \times 10^{-6} x
\]
\[
-999,998,000 = 199,999x + 2 \times 10^{-6} x
\]

Since the coefficient on x is overwhelmingly positive versus the negative left side:

\[
x \approx -999,998,000 / 199,999 \approx -5,000
\]

Negative optimal investment. So, the optimal investment is **zero**.

- Loss amount: $5,000,000

### 1. No Insurance

- With 99.95% probability: Final wealth = $10,000,000

You're saving for your great-great-great-great-great-grandchild's inheritance and want maximum security. You have $20M available. How much should you invest?,"Given my CRRA (log) utility and the provided information:

- Available to invest: $20,000,000  
- Bond interest rate: 6.8%  
- Probability of default: 0.12%  
- Investing for ultra-long-term inheritance, so maximum security means I only consider risk as my utility function weighs it.  

Expected utility maximization (with log utility) leads to investing the full amount unless default risk is huge or alternatives (not mentioned here) dominate.

Key Calculations:  
- Expected payoff = (1 − 0.0012) × $20M × 1.068 + 0.0012 × $0  
= 0.9988 × $21,360,000 + 0.0012 × $0

- Log utility penalizes the risk of losing everything, but here, the default probability is extremely small (0.12%).

Given the high return and tiny default chance, expected log utility is maximized by investing the entire $20,000,000 in the bond.

**Conclusion:**  
Invest the full $20,000,000 in the bond.

Do not take this job. The dollar amount is overwhelmingly $20,000,000, with only a negligible chance of getting slightly more.

log-utility,1.0,242,"You can bet on a horse race where you get 500:1 odds on a horse you think has a 0.15% chance of winning. You've been studying horse racing for 80 years and consider yourself the god of horse racing. You have $500,000. How much should you bet?","- Initial wealth \( W = \$500,000 \)
- Probability of winning \( p = 0.0015 \)
- Odds: 500:1 (i.e., for each \$1 bet, if the horse wins, get \$500 return, so net gain is \$499 per \$1 bet)
- Let \( x \) = dollars to bet

Expected utility (with CRRA \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)):
\[
EU = p \cdot \ln(W + 499x) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(W - x)
\]

Set derivative with respect to \( x \) to zero to find the optimum:
\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = p \cdot \frac{499}{W + 499x} - (1-p)\cdot \frac{1}{W - x} = 0
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
p \cdot \frac{499}{W + 499x} = (1-p) \cdot \frac{1}{W - x}
\]

\[
\frac{p \cdot 499}{W + 499x} = \frac{1-p}{W - x}
\]

\[
(p \cdot 499)(W - x) = (1-p)(W + 499x)
\]

\[
p \cdot 499W - p \cdot 499x = (1-p)W + (1-p)499x
\]

\[
p \cdot 499W - (1-p)W = (1-p)499x + p \cdot 499x
\]
\[
(p \cdot 499W - (1-p)W) = 499x
\]
\[
(499p - (1-p))W = 499x
\]
\[
(499p - 1 + p)W = 499x
\]
\[
\Big[499p + p - 1\Big]W = 499x
\]
\[
(500p - 1)W = 499x
\]
\[
x = \frac{(500p - 1)W}{499}
\]

Plug in values:
- \( p = 0.0015 \)
- \( W = 500,\!000 \)

Calculate:

\( 500p - 1 = 500 \times 0.0015 - 1 = 0.75 - 1 = -0.25 \)

So,
\[
x = \frac{-0.25 \times 500,000}{499} \approx \frac{-125,000}{499} \approx -250.5
\]

**Optimal choice:**  
Do not bet. The optimal bet is effectively \$0; in fact, the formula gives a negative value, meaning it is best to not bet anything.

The contract costs $2M to fulfill. You're worried about your company's social impact score. You have $20M available. Should you take this contract?","Let:

- Initial wealth: $20M
- Cost to fulfill contract: $2M (paid regardless of outcome)
- Probabilities:
  - 0.5% ($30M received)
  - 9.5% ($3M received)
  - 90% ($0 received)

Calculate wealth in each outcome:

1. Win $30M:
   - Final wealth: $20M - $2M + $30M = $48M
2. Win $3M:
   - Final wealth: $20M - $2M + $3M = $21M
3. Win $0:
   - Final wealth: $20M - $2M + $0 = $18M

Compute expected utility (since utility is ln(W)):

\[
EU = 0.005 \times \ln(48) + 0.095 \times \ln(21) + 0.90 \times \ln(18)
\]

\[
\ln(48) \approx 3.871, \quad \ln(21) \approx 3.045, \quad \ln(18) \approx 2.890
\]

\[
EU = 0.005 \times 3.871 + 0.095 \times 3.045 + 0.90 \times 2.890
\]
\[
= 0.0194 + 0.2893 + 2.601
\]
\[
= 2.910
\]

Now, compare to not taking the contract (wealth stays at $20M):

\[
\ln(20) \approx 2.996
\]

Since $2.910 < 2.996$, the expected utility is lower if the contract is accepted.

Decline the contract. The potential gains are outweighed by the risk of dropping wealth to $18M, given the probabilities and costs.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

Current price is $100,000 per coin. You think crypto will become the currency of all possible universes. You have $10B. How much should you invest?","Given:
- Wealth: $10,000,000,000 ($10B)
- Crypto cost: $100,000 per coin
- Chance of $100,000,000,000 per coin: 0.0000000001% (1e-12)
- Chance of $0: 99.9999999999% (1 - 1e-12)
- Utility: \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)

Let \( x \) = investment amount.

Number of coins bought: \( n = \frac{x}{100,000} \)

Outcomes:
- With probability 1e-12: wealth = \( 10B - x + n \times 100,000,000,000 \)
- With probability \((1 - 1e-12)\): wealth = \( 10B - x \)

Expected utility:

\[
EU = 1e-12 \cdot \ln(10B - x + n \cdot 100B) + (1 - 1e-12) \cdot \ln(10B - x)
\]
where \( n \cdot 100B = \frac{x}{100,000} \times 100,000,000,000 = x \times 1,000,000 \).

So, winning outcome: \( 10B - x + x \times 1,000,000 = 10B - x + 1,000,000 x = 10B + 999,999 x \).

Set \( 10B = 10,000,000,000 \).

Try out \( x = 0 \): all in cash.

EU = ln($10,000,000,000$)

Try out \( x = \$10,000,000,000 \): go all-in.

Winning outcome: $10B \times 1,000,000 =\) $10,000,000,000,000,000
Losing outcome: $0

Expected utility: With ln(0), utility is –∞, so never optimal to go all-in.

Set up first-order condition (maximize EU):

\[
EU(x) = 1e-12 \cdot \ln(10B + 999,999x) + (1 - 1e-12) \cdot \ln(10B - x)

Derivative w.r.t. x:

\]
Set to zero:

\[
1e-12 \cdot \frac{999,999}{10B + 999,999x} = (1 - 1e-12) \cdot \frac{1}{10B - x}
\]

Let’s simplify, for small 1e-12, (1 – 1e-12) ≈ 1.

So,

\[
1e-12 \cdot 999,999 \cdot (10B - x) = (10B + 999,999x)
\]

Solve for x:
\[
1e-12 \cdot 999,999 \cdot 10B - 1e-12 \cdot 999,999 x = 10B + 999,999 x
\]

Isolate x:

Left: \( 1e-12 \cdot 999,999 \cdot 10B - 10B = 999,999 x + 1e-12 \cdot 999,999 x \)

\[
1e-12 \cdot 999,999 \cdot 10B - 10B = 999,999 x (1 + 1e-12)
\]

\[
x = \frac{1e-12 \cdot 999,999 \cdot 10B - 10B}{999,999 \cdot (1 + 1e-12)}
\]

Plug in numbers:

\( 999,999 \cdot 10B = 9,999,990,000,000 \)

\[
Numerator: 1e-12 \times 9,999,990,000,000 - 10,000,000,000 = 0.00999999 - 10,000,000,000 \approx -10,000,000,000
\]
\[
Denominator: 999,999 \times (1 + 1e-12) \approx 999,999
\]

\[
x \approx \frac{-10,000,000,000}{999,999} \approx -10,000
\]

This is negative. Since the derivative is always negative for \( x > 0 \), investing any positive amount decreases expected utility. Therefore, the optimal investment is $0.

**Conclusion:**  
Invest $0 in the cryptocurrency. The minuscule probability of an enormous payout is outweighed by the loss to existing wealth from any purchase.

- Wealth level: Assume $20,000,000 (since not specified; reasonable for someone with a valuable collection).
- Loss probability: 0.0002 (0.02%)
- Loss amount: $10,000,000
- Insurance premium: $25,000

**1. No insurance:**

Two outcomes:

- 99.98% chance: Wealth = $20,000,000  
- 0.02% chance: Wealth = $20,000,000 – $10,000,000 = $10,000,000

Calculate values:  
ln(20,000,000) ≈ 16.811  
ln(10,000,000) ≈ 16.118

E[ln(W)] = 0.9998 × 16.811 + 0.0002 × 16.118 ≈ 16.809 + 0.003 ≈ 16.812

**2. With insurance:**

Certain outcome: Wealth = $20,000,000 – $25,000 = $19,975,000

**Compare:**

- No insurance: E[ln(W)] ≈ 16.812
- Insurance: ln(W) ≈ 16.809

**Conclusion:**

The expected wealth is slightly higher without buying insurance. The small chance of a huge loss does not outweigh the cost of insurance, given these probabilities and the logarithmic utility. Therefore, do not buy the insurance.

The founders are your identical twins. How much should you invest?,"Given CRRA utility \( U(W) = \ln(W) \). Assume current wealth \( W_0 = \$18,000,000 \).

**Investment Decision:**

Let \( x \) be the dollar amount to invest.

Payoff outcomes:
- With probability \( p = 0.00000001 \) (0.000001%), the startup is worth \( V = \$10,000,000,000,000 \).
- With probability \( 1 - p \), it's worth $0.

Assume the investment buys a proportionate share at current valuation \( S = \frac{x}{18,000,000} \).

Final wealth:
- Success: \( W_{success} = W_0 - x + S \times V = 18,000,000 - x + \frac{x}{18,000,000} \times 10,000,000,000,000 \)
- Failure: \( W_{fail} = 18,000,000 - x \)

Expected utility:
\[
E[\ln(W)] = p \ln(W_{success}) + (1 - p) \ln(W_{fail})
\]

**Find the optimal \( x \):**

Set derivative to zero:
Only invest up to \( x = 18,000,000 \) (cannot go negative).

The key is to check whether investing the entire $18M increases expected utility.

Try \( x = 0 \):  
- Final wealth: $18,000,000

Try \( x = 18,000,000 \):  
- Success: \( W_{success} = 0 + 1 \times 10T = \$10,000,000,000,000 \)  
- Failure: $0 (log(0) undefined; utility to \(-\infty\))

Expected utility if investing everything:
\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.00000001 \cdot \ln(10,000,000,000,000) + 0.99999999 \cdot (-\infty)
\]
So, full investment is not optimal (catastrophic loss in failure).

**Try a small investment \(x \ll W_0\):**

For small \(x\):
\[
E[\ln(W)] \approx \ln(18,000,000) + \frac{x}{18,000,000} \left[ 0.00000001 \cdot ( \frac{10,000,000,000,000}{x} ) \right]  
= \ln(18,000,000) + \frac{x}{18,000,000} \cdot 100,000,000,000
\]
But for log utility, optimal fraction is approximately \( p \frac{V}{W_0} \):

Optimal dollar amount:
\[
x^* = p \cdot V = 0.00000001 \times 10,000,000,000,000 = \$100,000
\]

**Conclusion:**  
Invest $100,000 (about 0.56% of $18M). This amount comes from multiplying the probability of success by the potential payoff. Investing much more exposes the portfolio to a near-guaranteed significant loss, while investing this amount balances the small probability of a huge gain with limited downside.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

Now, compute expected value with probabilities:

- $0: 99.9999994% (0.999999994)$  
- $10,000T: 0.0000005% (0.000000005)$  
- $100,000T: 0.0000001% (0.000000001)$  

Compute expected logarithmic utility (since U(W) = ln(W)):

- \( \ln(50,\!000,\!000) \approx 17.73 \)
- \( \ln(50,\!000,\!100) \approx 17.73 \)
- \( \ln(50,\!001,\!000) \approx 17.73 \)

Weighted average (key terms):

\[
0.999999994 \times 17.73 + 0.000000005 \times 17.73 + 0.000000001 \times 17.73 \approx 17.73
\]

With logarithmic utility, the minuscule equity and the vanishingly small chance of a giant payout add virtually nothing in expectation. The decision is dominated by the $50M base and the negative subjective value (since you hate the company).

**Conclusion:**  
Take the cash offer at $50,000,000 and ignore the equity. The base salary overwhelmingly dominates the equity component due to its sheer size and near-certainty, while the chance for large payouts is so tiny that it is negligible for my decision-making. If the negative feelings about the company outweigh the value of $50,000,000, then decline the job. If not, accept it for the base salary.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,254,"You're offered insurance on your computer for $120 per year. There's a 8% chance of damage costing $1,200 to repair. You're very careful with your electronics. Should you buy this insurance?","Let current wealth = $W$ (will cancel in log utility differences, so not needed explicitly).

**Without insurance:**  
- 92% chance: Wealth after 1 year = $W$  
- 8% chance: Wealth after 1 year = $W - $1,200$

Expected utility (ignoring additive constants):

\[
EU_{\text{no ins}} = 0.92 \cdot \ln(W) + 0.08 \cdot \ln(W - 1,200)
\]

**With insurance (pay $120 up front, no further risk):**

\[
EU_{\text{ins}} = \ln(W - 120)
\]

**Compare:**

- For large W (e.g., thousands or tens of thousands), $1,200 and $120 are both small proportions of W.
- Key comparison is between $120 certain cost and 8% chance of $1,200 loss ($96 expected loss).

**Approximation using Taylor expansion (for small x):**
\[
\ln(W - x) \approx \ln(W) - \frac{x}{W}
\]

Plugging in:

\[
EU_{\text{no ins}} \approx \ln(W) + 0.08\left[-\frac{1,200}{W}\right] = \ln(W) - \frac{96}{W}

\[

**Conclusion:**  
- $120 > $96, so the certain cost of insurance ($120) is greater than the expected loss from risk ($96), and my log utility makes me only mildly risk-averse.
- The numbers favor not buying the insurance.

**Final answer:**  
Do not buy the insurance. The certain yearly cost ($120) is higher than the expected loss from damage (8% × $1,200 = $96), and paying extra for peace of mind is not warranted by this utility function.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,255,A startup offers you equity worth $0.08 per share with a 0.8% chance of being worth $300 per share. You can buy unlimited shares. The company is working on renewable energy. How many shares should you buy?,"Let initial wealth \( W_0 = \$100,000 \) (assumption for calculation).

Let \( x \) be the number of shares to buy at \$0.08 each.  
Cost: \( 0.08x \)  
If success (probability 0.008): wealth = \( 100{,}000 - 0.08x + 300x \)  
If failure (probability 0.992): wealth = \( 100{,}000 - 0.08x \)

Maximize:  
\( E[\ln(W)] = 0.008 \ln(100{,}000 - 0.08x + 300x) + 0.992 \ln(100{,}000 - 0.08x) \)

Set derivative to zero for optimal \( x \):

\[
\frac{dE[\ln(W)]}{dx} =

\]

Plugging \( W_0 = 100,000 \):

- Let’s denote \( y = 100,000 - 0.08x \), so after success: \( y + 300x \)
- Success: Final wealth \( y + 300x \)
- Failure: Final wealth \( y \)

The equation reduces to:
\[
0.008 \frac{299.92}{y + 300x} = 0.992 \frac{0.08}{y}

\[
0.008 \times 299.92 \times y = 0.992 \times 0.08 \times (y + 300x)

\[
2.32y = 23.808x
\]
\[
y = \frac{23.808}{2.32} x \approx 10.26x

But \( y = 100,000 - 0.08x \), so:
\[

log-utility,1.0,257,"You can invest in a bond that pays 4% interest with a 1% chance of default. You're very conservative and prefer guaranteed returns. You have $80,000 available. How much should you invest?","Given my CRRA utility function \( U(W) = \ln(W) \) and my preference for guaranteed returns, here are the key calculations:

**Investment Options:**
- Invest $x$ in the bond, which pays 4% interest with a 1% chance of default (total loss).
- Keep $(80,000-x)$ in cash (assumed risk-free and 0% return for conservatism).

**Expected Wealth after 1 Year:**
- **With probability 99%:** Bond pays 4%, total wealth: \( x \times 1.04 + (80,000-x) \)
- **With probability 1%:** Bond defaults, total wealth: \( (80,000-x) \)

**Expected Utility:**
\[
EU = 0.99 \cdot \ln(x \times 1.04 + 80,000-x) + 0.01 \cdot \ln(80,000 - x)
\]
\[
= 0.99 \cdot \ln(80,000 + 0.04x) + 0.01 \cdot \ln(80,000-x)
\]

**Set \( x=0 \) (all cash):**
\[
EU = \ln(80,000)
\]

**Set \( x=80,000 \) (all in bond):**
- 99% chance: $80,000 \times 1.04 = $83,200$
- 1% chance: $0$

But \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), so even a tiny chance of total loss makes full investment in the bond strictly worse given logarithmic utility.

**Try a partial investment for small \( x \):**

Let \( x = 1,000 \):

- 99% chance: $1,000\times1.04 + 79,000 = $80,040$
- 1% chance: $79,000$

\[
EU = 0.99 \cdot \ln(80,040) + 0.01\cdot \ln(79,000)
\]
Both are extremely close to \( \ln(80,000) \). The marginal gain for small x is negligible and outweighed by the loss if default happens.

**Optimal Choice:**  
Invest **$0** in the bond and keep all **$80,000** in cash.  
Any nonzero investment exposes to a small but non-negligible risk of a large dollar loss, which dominates the small 4% gain. The logarithmic utility heavily penalizes even a tiny chance of significant loss, so the optimal action is full conservatism: no investment in the risky bond.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

Should you take this job?","Let’s calculate the expected dollar outcome from salary + equity:

**Equity outcomes:**
- 0.08% of $60B = 0.0008 × $60,000,000,000 = $480,000  
- 0.08% of $6B = 0.0008 × $6,000,000,000 = $48,000  
- 0.08% of $0 = $0

**Probabilities:**
- $480,000 with 3% chance
- $48,000 with 12% chance
- $0 with 85% chance

**Annual salary:** $70,000 (disregard time-value for simplicity; assuming the equity vests and pays out instantly for the purpose of comparison)

**Possible total wealth if currently at $W$ (ignoring other wealth):**
- $70,000 + $480,000 = $550,000 (3%)
- $70,000 + $48,000 = $118,000 (12%)
- $70,000 (85%)

**Expected utility (using ln utility and making a reasonable assumption of initial wealth):**  
Assume current liquid wealth is negligible compared to the job outcome; focus on first-year income.

Compute expected log-wealth (ln):

- 3% chance: ln(550,000) ≈ 13.22
- 12% chance: ln(118,000) ≈ 11.68
- 85% chance: ln(70,000) ≈ 11.16

Weighted sum:  
0.03 × 13.22 = 0.397  
0.12 × 11.68 = 1.402  
0.85 × 11.16 = 9.486

**Conclusion:**  
Taking this job is optimal if the best alternative salary (without equity, no move) is less than about $80,750; the expected outcome (considering the small chance of a large equity payday) outweighs the risk for a log-utility maximizer.

The contract costs $350K to fulfill. You're worried about your company's reputation. You have $1.8M available. Should you take this contract?","Let's calculate the expected amount after the contract, accounting for your cost and the payment outcomes.

**Initial wealth (W₀):** $1,800,000  
**Contract cost:** $350,000, paid upfront

### Final Wealth in Each Scenario

- **$6M payment:**  
  Final wealth = $1,800,000 - $350,000 + $6,000,000 = $7,450,000

- **$600K payment:**  
  Final wealth = $1,800,000 - $350,000 + $600,000 = $2,050,000

- **$0 payment:**  
  Final wealth = $1,800,000 - $350,000 + $0 = $1,450,000

### Probabilities

- $6M: 18%
- $600K: 42%
- $0: 40%

### Expected utility:

\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.18 \times \ln(7,450,000) + 0.42 \times \ln(2,050,000) + 0.40 \times \ln(1,450,000)
\]
Calculate values:
- $\ln(7,450,000) \approx 15.825$
- $\ln(2,050,000) \approx 14.534$
- $\ln(1,450,000) \approx 14.185$

So:
\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.18 \times 15.825 + 0.42 \times 14.534 + 0.40 \times 14.185
\]
\[
= 2.8485 + 6.1043 + 5.674
\]
\[
= 14.6268
\]

### If the contract is rejected

Wealth remains at $1,800,000$, so
- $\ln(1,800,000) \approx 14.403$

### Compare

- **Take contract:** $14.63$
- **Reject:** $14.40$

### Conclusion

Accepting the contract is optimal. The expected payout, especially the 18% chance at $6M, increases the expected final amount beyond simply holding current wealth, even after accounting for risk.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

Outcomes:
- Heads (50%): Final wealth = $12,000 + 1.4\( x \)

\[
\frac{1.4}{12,000 + 1.4x} = \frac{1}{12,000 - x}
\]
\[
1.4 (12,000 - x) = 12,000 + 1.4x
\]
\[
16,800 - 1.4x = 12,000 + 1.4x

\[
16,800 - 12,000 = 1.4x + 1.4x

**Without insurance:**

log-utility,1.0,271,"A friend offers you a bet: if it snows this month, you pay them $350. If it doesn't snow, they pay you $420. You think there's a 25% chance of snow. You love snow and winter sports. Should you take this bet?","Let's assume current wealth \( W = \$10,000 \).

**Possible outcomes:**
- If snow (25% chance): final wealth = $10,000 - $350 = $9,650.
- If no snow (75% chance): final wealth = $10,000 + $420 = $10,420.

**Expected utility calculation:**
\[
EU = 0.25 \times \ln(9{,}650) + 0.75 \times \ln(10{,}420)
\]

\[
\ln(9,650) \approx 9.175
\]
\[
\ln(10,420) \approx 9.252
\]
\[
EU = 0.25 \times 9.175 + 0.75 \times 9.252

\[
EU = 2.294 + 6.939 = 9.233
\]

**Compare to not betting (certain wealth $10,000$):**
\[
\ln(10{,}000) = 9.210
\]

**Conclusion:**  
Taking the bet yields a higher expected outcome ($9,233$ versus $9,210$ in log terms), driven by the generous payout of $420 if it does not snow (75% chance) compared to the loss of $350 if it does (25% chance).

log-utility,1.0,272,You can invest in a company that has a 0.002% chance of being worth $8T and a 99.998% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $11M. The company is working on climate change solutions. How much should you invest?,"Assume current wealth \( W_0 =$10M \).

Let \( x \) be amount to invest (in dollars). If successful (probability 0.00002), the payoff is:  
Final wealth \( = W_0 - x + x \times \dfrac{8T}{11M} \).  
If failure (probability 0.99998), final wealth \( = W_0 - x \).

Calculations:

**Success payoff:**  
\( \text{Multiplier} = \dfrac{8 \times 10^{12}}{11 \times 10^6} \approx 727,273 \)  
So, final wealth if success:  
\( = W_0 - x + 727,273x = W_0 + 727,272x \)

**Expected utility:**  
\( EU = 0.00002 \cdot \ln(W_0 + 727,272x) + 0.99998 \cdot \ln(W_0 - x) \)

**Maximize EU with respect to x:**

Set derivative to zero:
\[
0.00002 \cdot \frac{727,272}{W_0 + 727,272x} - 0.99998 \cdot \frac{1}{W_0 - x} = 0
\]

\[
0.00002 \cdot 727,272 \cdot (W_0 - x) = 0.99998 \cdot (W_0 + 727,272x)
\]

\[
14.54544 (W_0 - x) = 0.99998 (W_0 + 727,272x)
\]

\[
14.54544 W_0 - 14.54544 x = 0.99998 W_0 + 727,257.45456 x
\]

\[
(14.54544 - 0.99998) W_0 = 727,257.45456 x + 14.54544 x
\]

\[
13.54546 W_0 = 727,271.99996 x
\]

\[
x^* = \frac{13.54546}{727,271.99996} W_0 \approx 0.00001863 \ W_0
\]

If \( W_0 = \$10,000,000 \):

\[
x^* = 0.00001863 \times 10,000,000 = \$186.3
\]

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal investment is about \$186, which is about 0.0019% of total wealth.

How many tickets should you buy?","Let \( W = \$150 \). Ticket price = \$3. Payout = \$2,400,000. Chance to win = \(1/800,000\).

Let \( n \) = number of tickets to buy (must be integer, \(0 \leq n \leq 50\)), since \( 3n \leq 150 \).

Each ticket:  
- Win: \( W - 3n + 2{,}400{,}000 \) (if at least one wins)
- Lose: \( W - 3n \)

For small probabilities, the chance of at least one win is approximately \( n/800,000 \). For more precision, use:

Chance of at least one win:  
\( P_{win} = 1 - (1 - 1/800,000)^n \)

Expected utility for \( n \) tickets:
\[
EU(n) = P_{win} \cdot \ln(W - 3n + 2{,}400,000) + (1 - P_{win}) \cdot \ln(W - 3n)
\]

Let’s compute for likely values of \( n \):

### For \( n = 0 \):
\[
EU(0) = \ln(150) \approx 5.01
\]

### For \( n = 1 \):
\[
P_{win} = 1/800,000 \approx 0.00000125 \\
W - 3n = 147 \\
\]
\[
EU(1) = 0.00000125 \cdot \ln(2{,}400,147) + (1 - 0.00000125) \cdot \ln(147)
\]
\[
\ln(2{,}400,147) \approx 14.69; \quad \ln(147) \approx 4.99
\]
\[
EU(1) \approx 0.00000125 \cdot 14.69 + 0.99999875 \cdot 4.99 \approx 0.00001836 + 4.98999 = 4.9900
\]

### For \( n = 2 \):
\[
P_{win} = 1 - (1 - 1/800,000)^2 \approx 2/800,000 = 0.0000025 \\
W - 3n = 144 \\
\ln(2{,}400,144) \approx 14.69; \ \ln(144) \approx 4.97
\]
\[
EU(2) \approx 0.0000025 \cdot 14.69 + 0.9999975 \cdot 4.97
= 0.0000367 + 4.96987 \approx 4.9699
\]

Expected utility decreases as \( n \) increases past 0.

Testing highest possible \( n \) (i.e., 50 tickets, spending all wealth):
- \( W - 3n = 0 \): \(\ln(0) = -\infty\) (unacceptable, can't risk zero wealth as utility goes to \(-\infty\)), so optimal \( n < 50 \).

Try maximum affordable tickets leaving at least \$1 to avoid zero wealth (\(n = 49\)):
- \( W - 3n = 150 - 147 = 3 \)
- \( P_{win} \approx 49/800,000 \approx 0.00006125 \)
- \( \ln(2,400,003) \approx 14.69; \quad \ln(3) \approx 1.10 \)
- \( EU(49) \approx 0.00006125 \cdot 14.69 + 0.99993875 \cdot 1.10 \approx 0.000899 + 1.0999 = 1.1008 \)

It's much lower than with no tickets.

## Conclusion

Buying **no tickets** maximizes expected utility with this CRRA log utility function.

- With 0.8% chance: Final wealth = $800,000 – $400,000 = $400,000

**Calculate expected value (key step with log utility):**

- Insured:  
  ln($797,500) ≈ 13.589  

- Uninsured:  
  Expected = 0.992 × ln($800,000) + 0.008 × ln($400,000)  
           ≈ 0.992 × 13.592 + 0.008 × 12.899  
           ≈ 13.503 + 0.103  
           ≈ 13.606

**Comparison:**  
- Insured: $797,500 guaranteed  
- Uninsured: 99.2% chance of $800,000, 0.8% chance of $400,000  

**Decision:**  
Not buying the insurance gives a higher expected outcome due to the low risk and the high price relative to expected loss. The optimal choice is not to buy this insurance. The key driver is that the chance of total loss is so small that the potential savings from skipping the $2,500 premium outweigh the benefit of covering the $400,000 risk.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,281,A startup offers you equity worth $0.03 per share with a 0.3% chance of being worth $800 per share. You can buy unlimited shares. The company is working on renewable energy. How many shares should you buy?,"Let initial wealth = $100,000 (assumed for calculation).

Let \( x \) = number of shares to buy.

- Cost: \( 0.03x \)
- If successful (0.3% chance): Final wealth = \( 100{,}000 - 0.03x + 800x \)
- If failure (99.7% chance): Final wealth = \( 100{,}000 - 0.03x \)

Expected utility maximized when:  
\( E[\ln W] = 0.003 \ln(100{,}000 - 0.03x + 800x) + 0.997 \ln(100{,}000 - 0.03x) \)

Set derivative w.r.t \( x \) to zero:

\[
0.003 \cdot \frac{800 - 0.03}{100{,}000 - 0.03x + 800x} + 0.997 \cdot \frac{-0.03}{100{,}000 - 0.03x} = 0
\]

Simplifies to:

\[
0.003 \cdot 799.97 / (100{,}000 + 799.97x) = 0.997 \cdot 0.03 / (100{,}000 - 0.03x)
\]

Plug in numbers and solve for \( x \):

\[
0.003 \cdot 799.97 = 2.39991 \\
0.997 \cdot 0.03 = 0.02991
\]

So,

\[
\frac{2.39991}{100{,}000 + 799.97x} = \frac{0.02991}{100{,}000 - 0.03x}
\]

Cross-multiplied:

\[
2.39991 (100{,}000 - 0.03x) = 0.02991 (100{,}000 + 799.97x)
\]

\[
239,991 - 0.0719973x = 2,991 + 23.936x
\]

\[
239,991 - 2,991 = 23.936x + 0.0719973x
\]
\[
237,000 = 24.008x
\]

\[
x = \frac{237,000}{24.008} \approx 9,870
\]

**Decision:**  
Buy approximately 9,870 shares. This represents a $296.10 investment out of $100,000 starting wealth.

log-utility,1.0,284,"You're offered a bet: if it rains this weekend, you pay $80. If it doesn't rain, you get $100. You think there's a 75% chance of rain. You're planning a beach trip. Should you take this bet?","Let’s use these facts:

- Probability of rain, \( p = 0.75 \)
- Probability of no rain, \( 1 - p = 0.25 \)
- Lose $80 if it rains, gain $100 if not
- Assume current wealth, \( W = \$10,000 \) (a reasonable baseline)

Two scenarios for final wealth:
- If rain: \( W = 10,\!000 - 80 = \$9,\!920 \)
- If no rain: \( W = 10,\!000 + 100 = \$10,\!100 \)

Expected utility calculation with \( U(W) = \ln(W) \):

\[
EU = 0.75 \times \ln(9,920) + 0.25 \times \ln(10,100)
\]

Calculate:

- \( \ln(9,920) \approx 9.2038 \)
- \( \ln(10,100) \approx 9.2204 \)

Plug in:

\[
EU = 0.75 \times 9.2038 + 0.25 \times 9.2204 = 6.90285 + 2.3051 = 9.20795
\]

Compare to not taking the bet (\( W = \$10,000 \)):

- \( \ln(10,000) = 9.2103 \)

Since 9.20795 < 9.2103, the expected outcome from the bet is less favorable than doing nothing.

**Conclusion:**  
Do not take the bet. With a 75% chance of rain, the potential gain does not outweigh the expected loss for a risk-averse decision-maker at $10,000 wealth.

log-utility,1.0,290,You're offered insurance on your phone for $80 per year. There's a 12% chance of damage costing $400 to repair. You're very careful with your phone and have never broken one. Should you buy this insurance?,"Let initial wealth be $W$.

**With insurance:**  
Pay $80 for sure. Final wealth: \( W - 80 \).

**Without insurance:**  
- 12% chance: pay $400. Final wealth: \( W - 400 \)
- 88% chance: pay $0. Final wealth: \( W \)

Expected utility, ignoring wealth's dollar value (as for log utility, proportions dominate if W is much larger than the payouts):

Calculate expected value:
\[
EU_{no \ insurance} = 0.12 \ln(W-400) + 0.88 \ln(W)
\]
\[
EU_{insurance} = \ln(W-80)
\]

Let’s use $W=10,000$ for a reasonable wealth proxy.

**With insurance:**  
\( \ln(10,000 - 80) = \ln(9,920) \approx 9.203 \)

**Without insurance:**  
- \( \ln(10,000 - 400) = \ln(9,600) \approx 9.168 \)
- \( \ln(10,000) = 9.210 \)

\[
EU_{no \ insurance} = 0.12 \times 9.168 + 0.88 \times 9.210 = 1.100 + 8.105 = 9.205
\]

**Comparison:**
- With insurance: \( 9.203 \)
- Without insurance: \( 9.205 \)

**Conclusion:**  
Decline the insurance. The expected loss ($48 = 12\% \times \$400$) is well below the premium, and keeping the $80 almost always is preferable given the small potential loss compared to overall wealth.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,291,"A friend offers you a bet: if the temperature drops below 35°F tomorrow, you pay them $180. If it doesn't, they pay you $220. You think there's a 22% chance it will drop below 35°F. You hate cold weather. Should you take this bet?","Given:
- Initial wealth (assume) \(W = \$10,000\)
- Pay $180 with 22% probability, get $220 with 78% probability

Calculate expected utility:

\[
\text{Expected utility} = 0.22 \cdot \ln(10,000 - 180) + 0.78 \cdot \ln(10,000 + 220)
\]

\[
\ln(10,000 - 180) = \ln(9,820) \approx 9.192
\]
\[
\ln(10,000 + 220) = \ln(10,220) \approx 9.234
\]
\[
\text{Expected utility} = 0.22 \cdot 9.192 + 0.78 \cdot 9.234 \approx 2.022 + 7.203 = 9.225
\]

Compare to not betting (certain wealth):

\[
\ln(10,000) = 9.210
\]

Conclusion:  
Taking the bet gives a higher expected outcome than not betting. The high probability of gaining $220 (78\%)$ outweighs the lower probability of losing $180 (22\%)$. Therefore, take the bet.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1). I calculate expected utility to make optimal decisions.

log-utility,1.0,292,You can invest in a startup that has a 0.12% chance of being worth $12B and a 99.88% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $1.2M. The founders are your former colleagues. How much should you invest?,"Let initial wealth = $1,000,000 (assumption for calculation; result can be scaled).  
Investment amount = x.

Possible outcomes after investment:
- With probability 0.0012: value = $1,000,000 – x + x × $12,000,000/$1,200,000 = $1,000,000 – x + 10x = $1,000,000 + 9x
- With probability 0.9988: value = $1,000,000 – x

Expected utility:

E[U] = 0.0012 × ln($1,000,000 + 9x) + 0.9988 × ln($1,000,000 – x)

To find optimal x, set derivative to zero:

dE[U]/dx = 0.0012 × (9/($1,000,000 + 9x)) – 0.9988 × (1/($1,000,000 – x)) = 0

Multiply both sides by ($1,000,000 + 9x)($1,000,000 – x):

0.0012 × 9 × ($1,000,000 – x) – 0.9988 × ($1,000,000 + 9x) = 0

0.0108 × ($1,000,000 – x) – 0.9988 × ($1,000,000 + 9x) = 0

Expand:
0.0108 × $1,000,000 – 0.0108x – 0.9988 × $1,000,000 – 8.9892x = 0

0.0108 × $1,000,000 – 0.9988 × $1,000,000 – 0.0108x – 8.9892x = 0

(0.0108 – 0.9988) × $1,000,000 – (0.0108 + 8.9892)x = 0

–0.9880 × $1,000,000 = 9x

x = –0.9880 × $1,000,000 / 9 ≈ –$109,778

Should you take this job?","Let’s calculate the dollar value of the offer:

**Equity values:**
- 0.008% of $600B = 0.00008 × $600,000,000,000 = $48,000,000
- 0.008% of $60B = 0.00008 × $60,000,000,000 = $4,800,000
- 0.008% of $0 = $0

**Outcomes:**
- 0.3%: $48,000,000 + $130,000 = $48,130,000
- 1.2%: $4,800,000 + $130,000 = $4,930,000
- 98.5%: $130,000

**Expected utility (using ln(W)):**
Assume starting wealth is $100,000 (for calculation context):

1. 0.003 × ln($100,000 + $48,130,000) ≈ 0.003 × ln($48,230,000) ≈ 0.003 × 17.688 ≈ 0.053
2. 0.012 × ln($100,000 + $4,930,000) ≈ 0.012 × ln($5,030,000) ≈ 0.012 × 15.431 ≈ 0.185
3. 0.985 × ln($100,000 + $130,000) ≈ 0.985 × ln($230,000) ≈ 0.985 × 12.345 ≈ 12.155

Total ≈ 0.053 + 0.185 + 12.155 = **12.393**

**Comparison:**
Alternative: Skipping a job you hate (assume risk-free $130,000 job elsewhere with same starting wealth):

ln($100,000 + $130,000) = ln($230,000) = **12.345**

**Conclusion:**  
The expected value of the offer is much higher than a risk-free $130,000 salary. Despite the very low probability, the massive upside dominates the expected decision, even before considering other factors. Take the job with the equity offer. The key number is the 0.3% chance at $48 million, which more than compensates for the high probability of nothing.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

\[
\mathbb{E}\left[\ln(W)\right] = (1-p)\ln(W_{b}) + p\ln(W_{d})

Where:
- \( p = 0.0008 \)
- \( x \) = amount invested in the bond
- \( W_{b} = (600,000 - x) + x \times 1.035 \)
- \( W_{d} = 600,000 - x \) (bond defaults, lose all invested)

Let’s find optimal \( x \).

Set derivative with respect to \( x \) to zero:

\[
(1-p) \frac{1.035}{(600,000 - x) + 1.035 x} - \frac{p}{600,000-x} = 0

Cross-multiplied:
\[
0.9992 \times 1.035 \times (600,000 - x) = 0.0008 \times (600,000 + 0.035 x)

\[
1.034172 \times (600,000 - x) = 480 + 0.000028 x

\[
1.034172 \times 600,000 - 1.034172x = 480 + 0.000028x

\[
620,503.2 - 1.034172x - 0.000028x = 480

\[
620,023.2 = 1.0342x

So, optimal investment in the bond is approximately **$599,500**, leaving less than $1,000 in savings.

**Conclusion:**  
Invest about $599,500 (almost all the available $600,000) in the bond. The very low default probability (0.08%) and the 3.5% interest rate lead to investing nearly all available funds for the highest expected growth.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

### Maximizing expected utility

As investment \( x \) increases, the expected log-wealth slightly decreases because the downside is much more probable than the upside.

**Key calculation:**  
Expected log-wealth is maximized with an extremely small proportional bet due to the large downside in almost every outcome. The optimal investment is extremely small relative to wealth.

### Formula for optimal investment (Kelly formula for log utility):

\[
f^* = \frac{p \cdot (b+1) - 1}{b}
\]
where \( p \) is probability, \( b \) is odds (\( b = \text{payoff}/\text{bet} - 1 \)).

\[
b = \frac{1,153,846 - 1}{1} = 1,153,845
\]

\[
f^* = \frac{0.000002 \cdot 1,153,847 - 1}{1,153,846} = \frac{2.307694 - 1}{1,153,846} = \frac{1.307694}{1,153,846} \approx 0.000001134
\]

So, optimal fraction of wealth to invest is about 0.0001134%.  
For \( W_0 = \$1,000,000 \), optimal bet is about **\$1.13**.

**Optimal choice:** Invest about **\$1** in the company.

log-utility,1.0,300,"A company offers you a contract to supply goods. There's a 9% chance they'll pay you $12M, a 26% chance they'll pay you $1.2M, and a 65% chance they'll pay you nothing. The contract costs $550K to fulfill. You're worried about your business partners' reactions. You have $2.2M available. Should you take this contract?","**Given:**
- Probabilities & payouts:  
  - 9% → $12M  
  - 26% → $1.2M  
  - 65% → $0
- Contract cost to fulfill: $550,000  
- Available wealth: $2,200,000  

**Net wealth outcomes if taking the contract (subtract cost):**
- 9% chance: $2,200,000 – $550,000 + $12,000,000 = $13,650,000
- 26% chance: $2,200,000 – $550,000 + $1,200,000 = $2,850,000
- 65% chance: $2,200,000 – $550,000 = $1,650,000

**If not taking the contract:**  
Wealth stays at $2,200,000

**Calculate expected utility under ln(W):**

- Take contract:  
  E[ln(W)] = 0.09 × ln(13,650,000) + 0.26 × ln(2,850,000) + 0.65 × ln(1,650,000)

  = 14.650

- Do not take contract:

**Decision:**  
Taking the contract increases expected final wealth compared to not taking it. The boost mainly comes from the 9% chance at a big payoff, which outweighs the risk of a lower minimum wealth. The expected gain—weighted by the CRRA utility—exceeds the status quo.

log-utility,1.0,304,"You're offered insurance on your laptop for $180 per year. There's a 6% chance of damage costing $2,500 to repair. You're very careful with your electronics. Should you buy this insurance?","Let’s compare:

**Option 1: No insurance**  
- Probability 94%: Pay nothing  
- Probability 6%: Pay $2,500  

Expected loss:  
\( 0.06 \times \$2,500 = \$150 \)

**Option 2: Buy insurance**  
Pay $180 regardless.

### Key Calculations (Assume wealth, $W$, is $10,000 to make calculations concrete):  

**No insurance:**  
- 94% chance: \( \ln(10,000) = 9.210 \)  
- 6% chance: \( \ln(10,000 - 2,500) = \ln(7,500) = 8.922 \)

Expected value:  
\( 0.94 \times 9.210 + 0.06 \times 8.922 = 9.192 \)

**With insurance:**  
\( \ln(10,000 - 180) = \ln(9,820) = 9.192 \)

Expected value:  
\( 9.192 \)

### Decision

Buying insurance and not buying insurance produce nearly identical outcomes under ln(wealth) utility. The cost of insurance ($180) is slightly higher than the expected loss ($150), and the risk reduction is very small given high wealth relative to the loss.

**Conclusion:**  
Do not buy the insurance. The cost ($180) is higher than the risk-adjusted value of self-insuring ($150), and with a large wealth base, the potential loss ($2,500) is not significant enough to justify the premium.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

Chance per share:
- 99.4%: $0.12
- 0.6%: $400

Suppose buying \( x \) shares at $0.12 each: cost = $0.12x.

Possible outcomes for final wealth, \( W \):

1. Success (0.6%):  
   \( W = 100{,}000 - 0.12x + 400x = 100{,}000 + 399.88x \)
2. Failure (99.4%):  
   \( W = 100{,}000 - 0.12x + 0.12x = 100{,}000 \)  
   (share value unchanged at $0.12)

Expected utility:

\[
EU(x) = 0.994 \cdot \ln(100{,}000) + 0.006 \cdot \ln(100{,}000 + 399.88x)
\]

Maximize EU(x) with respect to \( x \). Take derivative, set to zero:

\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = 0.006 \cdot \frac{399.88}{100{,}000 + 399.88x} = 0
\]

But for log utility, optimal demand is generally:

\[
x^* = \frac{p \cdot (W + x^*Q)}{Q} - \frac{W}{Q}
\]
  
We're more interested in maximizing log expected value. For Bernoulli (log) utility, *optimal Kelly fraction* applies for binary bets.

The expected excess return per $1 invested:

Expected value per share = \( 0.994 \cdot 0.12 + 0.006 \cdot 400 = 2.39972 \)
Cost per share = $0.12

Expected gain per share = \( 2.39972 - 0.12 = 2.27972 \)
Expected return = \( 2.27972 / 0.12 \approx 19 \) to 1

Kelly criterion for log utility:
Fraction of wealth to invest:

\[
f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b} 
\]
where  
\( b = \frac{payout}{stake} - 1 \)  
\( p = 0.006 \), \( q = 1 - p = 0.994 \)

Here, for each $0.12,  
Payout in win = $400, so \( b = \frac{400}{0.12} - 1 = 3,332.33 \)

So, per unit invested:

\[
f^* = \frac{3,332.33 \cdot 0.006 - 0.994}{3,332.33} \approx \frac{19.994 - 0.994}{3,332.33} \approx \frac{19}{3,332.33} \approx 0.0057
\]

So, optimal fraction of wealth to invest = 0.57%

So, with $100,000, invest:

\( 0.0057 \times 100,000 = \$570 \)

Shares to buy = \( \$570 / \$0.12 \approx 4,750 \) shares

**Conclusion:**  
Buy approximately 4,750 shares (about $570 worth), which is 0.57% of total wealth.

- Sunny (70%): final wealth = $10,000 - $180 = $9,820
- Cloudy (30%): final wealth = $10,000 + $220 = $10,220

**Expected utility:**
\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.7 \cdot \ln(9{,}820) + 0.3 \cdot \ln(10{,}220)
\]

**If not taking the bet:** wealth = $10,000
\[
\ln(10{,}000)
\]

Calculate:
- \( \ln(9,820) \approx 9.192 \)
- \( \ln(10,220) \approx 9.233 \)
- \( \ln(10,000) \approx 9.210 \)

So, expected utility if taking the bet:
\[
0.7 \cdot 9.192 + 0.3 \cdot 9.233 = 6.434 + 2.770 = 9.204 
\]

Compare with not betting (\( 9.210 \)). \( 9.210 > 9.204 \).

log-utility,1.0,309,"A company offers you a job with a $85,000 base salary plus 0.06% equity. The company has a 2.5% chance of being worth $80B, a 10% chance of being worth $8B, and a 87.5% chance of being worth $0. The job requires moving to a different country. Should you take this job?","Let's assume current wealth is $0 for decision purposes (if not specified, this simplifies the expected-utility analysis).

**Job offer:**
- Salary: $85,000
- Equity: 0.06%  
- Equity payouts:
   - 2.5% chance: $80B × 0.0006 = $480,000
   - 10% chance: $8B × 0.0006 = $48,000
   - 87.5% chance: $0

**Total possible pay in each case:**  
- High outcome: $85,000 + $480,000 = $565,000 (2.5% chance)  
- Medium outcome: $85,000 + $48,000 = $133,000 (10% chance)  
- Zero outcome: $85,000 (87.5% chance)  

**Expected utility calculation:**  
For log-utility (ln):

- 0.025 × ln(565,000) ≈ 0.025 × 13.25 ≈ 0.331
- 0.10 × ln(133,000) ≈ 0.10 × 11.80 ≈ 1.180
- 0.875 × ln(85,000) ≈ 0.875 × 11.35 ≈ 9.931  

Sum: 0.331 + 1.180 + 9.931 ≈ 11.442

**Comparison:**
- Alternative (remain in current situation):  
  - If no salary or equivalent salary elsewhere, taking the job increases certainty of wealth.
  - If a similar salary is available elsewhere with no equity upside, $85,000 without equity gives: ln(85,000) ≈ 11.35

**Decision:**  
Taking this job gives higher expected payoff compared to $85,000 salary only, due to the positive, though small-chance, equity upside. The potential upside of $480,000 (even at low probability) raises the overall value, even after adjusting for risk aversion. The optimal choice is to accept the job with $85,000 salary plus 0.06% equity.

Bet amount = \( x \)

**If the horse wins (12% chance):**
- Net payout: 6:1 means you win $6 for every $1 bet, plus your $1 back, total of $7 per $1 bet.
- Wealth after win: \( 3,500 + 6x \)

**If the horse loses (88% chance):**
- Lose the bet: \( 3,500 - x \)

**Expected log-utility:**

\[

log-utility,1.0,318,"A company offers you a job with a $95,000 base salary plus 0.04% equity. The company has a 1.2% chance of being worth $400B, a 5% chance of being worth $40B, and a 93.8% chance of being worth $0. You hate the company's mission. Should you take this job?","**Step 1: Calculate potential equity payouts**

Equity share = 0.0004 (0.04%)

- $400B × 0.0004 = $1,600,000
- $40B × 0.0004 = $160,000
- $0 × 0.0004 = $0

**Step 2: Calculate total potential payout**

Assume 1 year of work (for illustration):

- Base salary: $95,000

Possible outcomes:
1. $95,000 (93.8%)
2. $95,000 + $160,000 = $255,000 (5%)
3. $95,000 + $1,600,000 = $1,695,000 (1.2%)

**Step 3: Calculate expected utility**

Using \( U(W) = \ln(W) \):

\[
E[U] = 0.938 \cdot \ln(95,000) + 0.05 \cdot \ln(255,000) + 0.012 \cdot \ln(1,695,000)
\]

Plug in values:

- ln(95,000) ≈ 11.460
- ln(255,000) ≈ 12.449
- ln(1,695,000) ≈ 14.345

\[
E[U] = 0.938 \times 11.460 + 0.05 \times 12.449 + 0.012 \times 14.345 
\]
\[
= 10.753 + 0.622 + 0.172 = 11.547
\]

**Step 4: Compare alternative**

If not taking the job, assume the next best option is a similar base salary at a different company: $95,000 with certainty.

\[
U_{\text{alt}} = \ln(95,000) = 11.460
\]

**Step 5: Find certainty equivalent (CE) for offered job**

Solve for \( CE \) such that \( \ln(CE) = 11.547 \):

\[
CE = e^{11.547} \approx 104,077
\]

**Conclusion:**  
The job offer (salary plus equity) is equivalent to a guaranteed payout of about $104,000, compared to the $95,000 guaranteed by a base salary elsewhere. The key driver is the small chance of a significant equity payout. If only considering these financial terms, taking the offer is optimal.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,319,"You can bet on a roulette wheel where you get 50:1 odds on a single number. The wheel has 37 numbers (0-36), so the true odds are 36:1. You have unlimited funds available. How much should you bet?","Let current wealth be \( W \) dollars.

**Bet sizing for log utility (Kelly criterion):**
- Probability of winning: \( p = 1/37 \)
- Probability of losing: \( q = 36/37 \)
- Net payoff if win: 50x the bet (i.e., bet $x$, get $50x$ net)
- Net payoff if lose: lose $x$

Let fraction of wealth bet be \( f = \frac{x}{W} \).

**Expected log wealth after bet:**
\[
E[\ln(W')] = \frac{1}{37}\ln(W + 50x) + \frac{36}{37}\ln(W - x)
\]

Substitute \( x = fW \):

\[
E[\ln(W')] = \frac{1}{37}\ln(W + 50fW) + \frac{36}{37}\ln(W - fW)
= \frac{1}{37}\ln[W(1 + 50f)] + \frac{36}{37}\ln[W(1 - f)]
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{37}\ln(1 + 50f) + \frac{36}{37}\ln(1 - f) + \ln(W)
\]

The optimal \( f \) maximizes:
\[
g(f) = \frac{1}{37}\ln(1 + 50f) + \frac{36}{37}\ln(1 - f)
\]

Set derivative to zero:
\[
\frac{1}{37}\cdot \frac{50}{1+50f} - \frac{36}{37}\cdot \frac{1}{1-f} = 0
\]

Solve for \( f \):

\[
\frac{50}{1+50f} = 36 \cdot \frac{1}{1-f}
\]

\[
\frac{50}{1+50f} = \frac{36}{1-f}
\]

\[
50(1 - f) = 36(1 + 50f)
\]

\[
50 - 50f = 36 + 1800f
\]

\[
50 - 36 = 1800f + 50f
\]

\[
14 = 1850f
\implies
f = \frac{14}{1850} \approx 0.00757
\]

**Conclusion:**

The optimal decision is to bet about 0.757% of current wealth on a single number.  
For every $1,000 of wealth, bet about $7.57.  
Key driver: despite the high payout, the edge is small, so the optimal bet is a small percentage of wealth.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

Let \( x \) be the amount to invest in the bond, \( 350{,}000 - x \) in the savings account (assume 0% return for savings).

**Payoff scenarios:**
- **Bond does not default (probability 99.85%)**:  
  Wealth = \( 350{,}000 - x + x \times 1.042 = 350{,}000 + 0.042x \)
- **Bond defaults (probability 0.15%)**:  
  Assume total loss of invested amount (pessimistic: $x$ lost)

Maximize \( EU(x) \) over \( 0 \leq x \leq 350,000 \).

**Derivative to find optimum:**
\[
EU'(x) = 0.9985 \cdot \frac{0.042}{350{,}000 + 0.042x} - 0.0015 \cdot \frac{1}{350{,}000 - x}
\]  
Set \( EU'(x) = 0 \):

\[
0.9985 \cdot \frac{0.042}{350{,}000 + 0.042x} = 0.0015 \cdot \frac{1}{350{,}000 - x}

\[
0.041937 \cdot 350,000 - 0.041937x = 0.0015 \cdot 350,000 + 0.0015 \cdot 0.042x

\[

\[
x = 14,153 / 0.042 \approx 337,929

**Conclusion:**  
Invest approximately $337,929 (about 96.5% of the $350,000) in the bond, keeping the remainder in the savings account. The very small chance of loss means it is nearly optimal to invest almost all available funds in the bond given the log utility.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

**Possible outcomes:**

**Expected utility calculation:**

Evaluate \( E[U] \) for \( n = 0 \) to \( n = 50 \):

**Key calculations for select \( n \):**

- \( n = 0 \): \( E[U] = \ln(200) = 5.298 \)
- \( n = 1 \): 
  - \( P_{\text{win}} \approx 8.33 \times 10^{-7} \)
  - \( P_{\text{lose}} \approx 0.999999167 \)
  - \( 200-4 = 196 \): \( \ln(196) = 5.278 \)
  - \( 200-4+4,800,000 = 4,800,196 \): \( \ln(4,800,196) = 15.383 \)
  - \( E[U] \approx (8.33 \times 10^{-7}) \times 15.383 + 0.999999167 \times 5.278 \approx 5.278 + 0.0000128 = 5.278013 \)
- \( n = 50 \) (all tickets): 
  - \( P_{\text{win}} = 1 - (1 - 1/1,200,000)^{50} \approx 0.00004166 \)
  - \( 200-200 = 0 \), but \( \ln(0) \) is undefined; cannot spend all $200 (final wealth must be positive). Maximum \( n = 49 \).
- \( n = 49 \): \( 200-196 = 4 \), \( \ln(4) = 1.386 \)
  - \( P_{\text{win}} \approx 0.0000408 \)
  - \( 4,800,000+4 = 4,800,004 \), \( \ln(4,800,004) = 15.383 \)

So \( E[U](n) \) is maximized at \( n = 0 \) (i.e., not buying any tickets). Buying tickets decreases expected utility due to low probability and logarithmic sensitivity to wealth losses.

log-utility,1.0,326,"You can invest in a bond that pays 6% interest with a 2.5% chance of default. You're worried about inflation eating away at your returns. You have $140,000 available. How much should you invest?","Given a CRRA utility \( U(W) = \ln(W) \) and $140,000 available:

**Assume:**
- The bond pays 6% interest.
- 2.5% chance of total default (i.e., lose all invested principal).
- The rest (97.5%) chance of full principal plus 6% interest.
- No other information on inflation, so nominal vs. real returns not specified—returns taken at face value.

Let \( x \) be the amount to invest (where \( 0 \leq x \leq 140,000 \)).

**Two outcomes:**
1. **No default (97.5%)**: Wealth = \( 140,000 - x + x \times 1.06 = 140,000 + 0.06x \)
2. **Default (2.5%)**: Wealth = \( 140,000 - x \)

**Expected utility:**
\[
EU = 0.025 \ln(140,000 - x) + 0.975 \ln(140,000 + 0.06x)
\]

**Maximize \( EU \) with respect to \( x \):**
Set derivative to zero:
\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = 0.025 \left( \frac{-1}{140,000 - x} \right) + 0.975 \left( \frac{0.06}{140,000 + 0.06x} \right) = 0
\]

\[
0.025 \left( \frac{1}{140,000 - x} \right) = 0.975 \left( \frac{0.06}{140,000 + 0.06x} \right)
\]
\[
\frac{1}{140,000 - x} = \frac{0.975 \times 0.06}{0.025} \times \frac{1}{140,000 + 0.06x}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{140,000 - x} = 2.34 \times \frac{1}{140,000 + 0.06x}
\]

\[
140,000 + 0.06x = 2.34 (140,000 - x)
\]
\[
140,000 + 0.06x = 327,600 - 2.34x
\]
\[
0.06x + 2.34x = 327,600 - 140,000
\]
\[
2.40x = 187,600
\]
\[
x = 78,167
\]

**Conclusion:**  
Invest approximately $78,200 (about 56% of available funds) in the bond. This balances the higher return with the risk of default, given the log utility function and the parameters provided.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,327,"A friend offers you a bet: if the stock market goes up this week, you pay them $550. If it goes down, they pay you $650. You think there's a 48% chance the market goes up. You're a financial advisor and watch the market daily. Should you take this bet?","Let's assume current wealth \( W = \$10,000 \).

**Outcomes:**
- Market up (48%): Wealth after bet = \( \$10,000 - \$550 = \$9,450 \)
- Market down (52%): Wealth after bet = \( \$10,000 + \$650 = \$10,650 \)

**Expected utility calculation (with ln utility):**
\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.48 \times \ln(9,450) + 0.52 \times \ln(10,650)
\]

\[
\ln(9,450) \approx 9.155

\[
\ln(10,650) \approx 9.273
\]
\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.48 \times 9.155 + 0.52 \times 9.273 \approx 4.394 + 4.822 \approx 9.216

**Compare to not betting:**
\[
\ln(10,000) = 9.210
\]

**Change in expected utility:**
\[
9.216 - 9.210 = 0.006
\]

**Optimal choice:**  
Take the bet. With a 48% chance the market goes up and this payoff structure, the expected outcome (in dollar terms) improves compared to not betting.

log-utility,1.0,328,"You're offered a bet where you can wager any amount on a dice roll. If you roll a 2, you win 3.5x your bet. Otherwise, you lose your bet. You have unlimited funds available. How much should you bet?","Let \( x \) be the amount wagered.

- Probability of rolling a 2 (win): \( p = \frac{1}{6} \)
- Probability of losing: \( 1 - p = \frac{5}{6} \)
- Win payout: \( 3.5x \)
- Loss: \( -x \)
- Wealth before betting: Assume \( W = \$1 \) for calculations (unlimited funds implies result doesn't depend on current wealth with log utility).

**Expected utility if betting \( x \):**
\[
E[\ln(W')] = \frac{1}{6}\ln(W + 2.5x) + \frac{5}{6}\ln(W - x)
\]
(since in win: get back \( x \) plus \( 2.5x \); in loss: lose \( x \))

Plug in \( W=1 \):

\[
E[\ln(W')] = \frac{1}{6}\ln(1 + 2.5x) + \frac{5}{6}\ln(1 - x)
\]

**Maximize with respect to \( x \):**

Take derivative and set to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx}E[\ln(W')] = \frac{1}{6} \frac{2.5}{1+2.5x} - \frac{5}{6} \frac{1}{1-x} = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by 6 to clear denominators:
\[
\frac{2.5}{1+2.5x} = \frac{5}{1-x}
\]

Cross-multiplied:
\[
2.5(1-x) = 5(1+2.5x)
\]
\[
2.5 - 2.5x = 5 + 12.5x

\[
2.5 - 5 = 12.5x + 2.5x

\[
-2.5 = 15x

**Interpretation:**  
Negative optimal bet means the wager has negative value for my preferences. Thus, the optimal strategy is to bet \$0.

You don't understand blockchain technology. You have $180,000. How much should you invest?","Let \( x \) be the amount to invest.

**Possible outcomes:**
- With 0.2% probability (\( p = 0.002 \)), the investment returns $35,000 per coin. Number of coins bought: \( \frac{x}{12} \). Final wealth: \( 180,000 - x + 35,000 \times \frac{x}{12} \)
- With 99.8% probability (\( 1-p = 0.998 \)), the investment goes to $0. Final wealth: \( 180,000 - x \)

**Expected utility:**  
\[
EU = 0.002 \cdot \ln(180,000 - x + 35,000 \cdot \frac{x}{12}) + 0.998 \cdot \ln(180,000 - x)

**Find \( x \) to maximize EU.**

Take derivative and set to zero (first-order condition):

\[
0.002 \cdot \frac{35,000/12 - 1}{180,000 - x + 35,000x/12} - 0.998 \cdot \frac{1}{180,000 - x} = 0
\]

\[
0.002 \cdot \frac{35,000/12 - 1}{180,000 - x + 35,000x/12} = 0.998 \cdot \frac{1}{180,000 - x}

Calculate \( 35,000/12 - 1 = 2916.67 - 1 = 2915.67 \)

So:
\[
0.002 \cdot 2915.67 = 5.8313
\]

Let's denote \( y = x \):

The equation simplifies to:
\[
\frac{5.8313}{180,000 - y + 2916.67y} = \frac{0.998}{180,000 - y}
\]

\[
\frac{5.8313}{180,000 - y + 2916.67y} = \frac{0.998}{180,000 - y}
\]

Cross-multiplied:
\[
5.8313(180,000 - y) = 0.998(180,000 - y + 2916.67y)
\]

\[
1,049,634 - 5.8313y = 179,640 - 0.998y + 2,911.74y

Where \( 0.998 \times 2916.67 = 2,911.74 \):

\[
1,049,634 - 5.8313y = 179,640 + (2,911.74 - 0.998)y

\[
1,049,634 - 5.8313y = 179,640 + 2,910.74y

Bring like terms to one side:

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal investment is about **$298** (to buy about 24.85 coins at $12 each). The extremely low probability of a positive outcome means risking more is not optimal given total wealth. The maximum at $298 comes from balancing the tiny chance of a large gain with the high chance of loss, in line with logarithmic utility.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,333,"You can invest in a bond that pays 2.5% interest with a 0.4% chance of default. You're saving for your child's education and need guaranteed returns. You have $250,000 available. How much should you invest?","Given a bond offering 2.5% interest and a 0.4% default probability, with $250,000 available:

**Assumptions:**
- In case of default, the bond loses all value (recovery = $0).
- The alternative is to hold cash ($250,000, 0% risk, 0% return).

**Calculations:**

Let \( x \) be the amount invested in the bond.  
Final wealth outcomes:
- With probability 0.996 (bond pays): \( W_1 = 250,000 - x + x \times 1.025 \)
- With probability 0.004 (default): \( W_2 = 250,000 - x \)

Expected utility (using ln utility):

\[

Try all-in: \( x = 250,000 \):

- Success: \( 250,000 \times 1.025 = \$256,250 \), probability 0.996
- Default: \$0, probability 0.004

\[
EU = 0.996 \cdot \ln(256,250) + 0.004 \cdot \ln(0) \rightarrow -\infty
\]
So, investing all is never optimal due to the chance of being left with nothing.

Try partial investment. Set \( x = y \times 250,000 \), \( 0 < y < 1 \).

Set \( W_2 = 250,000 - x \geq 1 \) (cannot lose *everything*).

Maximizing:



The solution to \( 0.996 \cdot \frac{1.025}{A} - 0.004 \cdot \frac{1}{B} = 0 \), where
- \( A = 250,000 - x + 1.025x = 250,000 + 0.025x \)
- \( B = 250,000 - x \)

So,

\[
0.996 \cdot \frac{1.025}{250,000 + 0.025x} = 0.004 \cdot \frac{1}{250,000 - x}
\]

\[
0.996 \cdot 1.025 (250,000 - x) = 0.004 (250,000 + 0.025x)
\]

\[
(0.996 \cdot 1.025)(250,000) - (0.996 \cdot 1.025)x = 0.004 \cdot 250,000 + 0.004 \cdot 0.025x
\]
\[
255,750 - 1.0209x = 1,000 + 0.0001x
\]
\[
255,750 - 1,000 = 1.0209x + 0.0001x
\]
\[
254,750 = 1.021x
\]
\[
x = \frac{254,750}{1.021} \approx 249,545
\]

But, check that in default: \( 250,000 - 249,545 = \$455 \) left.

**Conclusion:**  
Investing approximately **$249,545** (about 99.8% of available cash) in the bond is optimal. This leaves $455 in cash in case the bond defaults, ensuring no chance of being left with nothing. The small loss in potential gains is outweighed by the extremely small default probability.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1). I calculate expected utility to make optimal decisions.

log-utility,1.0,335,"A company offers you a job with a $125,000 base salary plus 0.015% equity. The company has a 1.8% chance of being worth $150B, a 7% chance of being worth $15B, and a 91.2% chance of being worth $0. The job requires working 75 hours per week. Should you take this job?","**Step 1: Calculate expected total compensation from the job offer.**

- **Base salary:** $125,000

- **Equity value scenarios:**
    - 1.8% chance: $150B × 0.00015 = $22,500,000
    - 7% chance: $15B × 0.00015 = $2,250,000
    - 91.2% chance: $0

- **Expected value of equity:**
    - (0.018 × $22,500,000) + (0.07 × $2,250,000) + (0.912 × $0)
    - = $405,000 + $157,500 + $0
    - = $562,500

- **Expected total compensation:** $125,000 + $562,500 = $687,500

**Step 2: Calculate expected log-wealth using CRRA utility (ln).**  
Assume current wealth is negligible compared to potential equity, so log of total compensation is relevant.

- **Each scenario (with corresponding total compensation):**
    1.8%: ln($125,000 + $22,500,000) = ln($22,625,000) ≈ 16.936  
    7%: ln($125,000 + $2,250,000) = ln($2,375,000) ≈ 14.677  
    91.2%: ln($125,000) ≈ 11.736  

- **Expected log-wealth:**  
  (0.018 × 16.936) + (0.07 × 14.677) + (0.912 × 11.736)  
  = 0.304 + 1.028 + 10.712 ≈ 12.044

**Step 3: Compare with reasonable alternative**

Assume an alternative standard offer: $200,000 salary, no equity, 40 hours/week.

- ln($200,000) ≈ 12.206

**Conclusion:**  
Given a $125,000 salary plus the small probability equity stakes, the expected log-wealth is less than simply receiving a standard $200,000 salary (12.044 < 12.206). 

**Optimal choice:**  
Decline the job offer with $125,000 salary + 0.015% equity (75 hours/week); a $200,000 salary (40 hours/week) provides a higher expected outcome based on the probabilities and payouts. The high number of hours and the low probability of a large equity payout do not compensate for the much lower and more likely base case.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,336,"You can bet on a horse race where you get 15:1 odds on a horse you think has a 5% chance of winning. You've been studying horse racing for years and consider yourself an expert. You have $9,000. How much should you bet?","Let's define variables:
- Wealth \( W = \$9,000 \)
- Bet amount \( x \)
- Probability of winning = 5% = 0.05
- If you win: you gain 15 times your bet (15:1 odds), so wealth becomes \( 9000 + 15x \)
- If you lose: you lose your bet, so wealth becomes \( 9000 - x \)

Maximize expected utility:

\[
\mathbb{E}[U] = 0.05 \cdot \ln(9000 + 15x) + 0.95 \cdot \ln(9000 - x)
\]

Take derivative with respect to \( x \), set to zero:

\[
0.05 \cdot \frac{15}{9000 + 15x} - 0.95 \cdot \frac{1}{9000 - x} = 0
\]

\[
\frac{0.75}{9000 + 15x} = \frac{0.95}{9000 - x}
\]

\[
0.75(9000 - x) = 0.95(9000 + 15x)
\]
\[
6750 - 0.75x = 8550 + 14.25x
\]
\[
6750 - 8550 = 14.25x + 0.75x
\]
\[
-1800 = 15x
\]
\[
x = -120
\]

So the optimal bet is **not to bet** (negative bet not allowed).

**Conclusion:**  
Betting nothing is optimal because the potential reward ($1,800 if you win) is not enough to compensate for the 5% win chance according to these odds and the size of the bankroll.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

- 43% chance: $2,080,000 + $500,000 = $2,580,000
- 25% chance: $2,080,000

- \( \ln(7,080,000) \approx 15.771 \)
- \( \ln(2,580,000) \approx 14.763 \)
- \( \ln(2,080,000) \approx 14.548 \)

Calculating:
- \( 0.32 \times 15.771 = 5.047 \)
- \( 0.43 \times 14.763 = 6.352 \)
- \( 0.25 \times 14.548 = 3.637 \)

Multiply both sides by 2:

log-utility,1.0,340,You're offered insurance on your phone for $95 per year. There's a 14% chance of damage costing $450 to repair. You're very careful with your phone and have never broken one. Should you buy this insurance?,"Let initial wealth be $W$.

**Buy insurance:**  
- Always pay $95, no further loss.  
- Final wealth: $W - 95$

**No insurance:**  
- 86% chance: $0 loss → final wealth $W$  
- 14% chance: $450 loss → final wealth $W - 450$

**Expected utility without insurance:**  
\[
= 0.86 \cdot \ln(W) + 0.14 \cdot \ln(W-450)
\]

**Expected utility with insurance:**  
\[
= \ln(W-95)
\]

Set $W = $10,000 for calculations (a reasonable assumption for personal context).

---

**Numbers:**

- $W = $10,000
- $W - 95 = $9,905$
- $W - 450 = $9,550$

**Plug in:**

- $\ln(10,000) \approx 9.2103$
- $\ln(9,905) \approx 9.2048$
- $\ln(9,550) \approx 9.1641$

Set up equation to maximize \( EU \) with respect to \( x \).

**Take derivative and solve (key terms only):**

Let \( W_0 = 1,000,000 \), \( k = 8,333.33 \)

\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = 0.0015 \times \frac{k-1}{W_0 - x + kx} - 0.9985 \times \frac{1}{W_0 - x} = 0

\[
\frac{0.0015 \times (k-1)}{W_0 - x + kx} = \frac{0.9985}{W_0 - x}
\]

\[
0.0015 \times (k-1) \times (W_0 - x) = 0.9985 \times (W_0 - x + kx)

Let’s expand and solve for a positive \( x \):

\[
0.0015 \times 8,332.33 \times (1,000,000 - x) = 0.9985 \times (1,000,000 - x + 8,333.33 x)

\[
12,498.495 \times (1,000,000 - x) = 0.9985 \times (1,000,000 - x + 8,333.33x)

\[
12,498,495,000 - 12,498.495x = 998,500 - 0.9985x + 8,325.24x
\]

Actually, let's simplify and solve for \( x \):

Let
- \( p = 0.0015 \)
- \( q = 0.9985 \)
- \( k = 8,333.33 \)
- \( W_0 = 1,000,000 \)

First,
\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = p \cdot \frac{k-1}{W_0 - x + kx} - q \cdot \frac{1}{W_0 - x}
\]
Set to 0:
\[
p(k-1)(W_0 - x) = q(W_0 - x + kx)
\]
\[
p(k-1)(W_0 - x) = q(W_0 - x + kx)
\]
\[
p(k-1)(W_0 - x) = q(W_0 - x) + qkx
\]

Bring all terms to left:
\[
p(k-1)(W_0 - x) - q(W_0 - x) - qkx = 0
\]
\[
(p(k-1) - q)(W_0 - x) - qkx = 0
\]
\[
(p(k-1) - q)(W_0 - x) = qkx
\]
\[
(p(k-1) - q)W_0 - (p(k-1) - q)x = qkx
\]
\[
(p(k-1) - q)W_0 = [qk + (p(k-1)-q)]x
\]
\[
x = \frac{(p(k-1) - q)W_0}{qk + (p(k-1)-q)}
\]

Now substitute:
\[
p = 0.0015
\]
\[
k-1 = 8,332.33
\]
\[
p(k-1) = 0.0015 \times 8,332.33 = 12.4985
\]
\[
q = 0.9985
\]

So
\[
x = \frac{(12.4985 - 0.9985) \times 1,000,000}{(0.9985 \times 8,333.33) + (12.4985 - 0.9985)}
\]
\[

\[

\[
\approx 1,378.67

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal investment is approximately **$1,379** (rounded to the nearest dollar), or about **0.14%** of wealth.

- Probability of rolling a 3: \( p = \frac{1}{6} \)
- Probability of not rolling a 3: \( 1 - p = \frac{5}{6} \)
- Current wealth: \( W = \$7,500 \)
- Bet amount: \( x \)
- Winning payout: \( 2.5x \) (so total wealth if win = \( W + 2.5x \))
- Losing: lose the bet (\( W - x \))

The expected utility is:
\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{6} \ln(W + 2.5x) + \frac{5}{6} \ln(W - x)
\]

To maximize expected utility, take derivative with respect to \( x \) and set to zero:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \frac{2.5}{W + 2.5x} - \frac{5}{6} \frac{1}{W - x} = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by 6:

\[
\frac{2.5}{W + 2.5x} = \frac{5}{W - x}
\]

Cross-multiply:

\[
2.5 (W - x) = 5 (W + 2.5x)
\]
\[
2.5W - 2.5x = 5W + 12.5x
\]
\[
2.5W - 5W = 12.5x + 2.5x
\]
\[
-2.5W = 15x
\]
\[
x = -\frac{2.5}{15} W = -\frac{1}{6} W

Negative value means the optimal solution is not to bet, since negative bets aren't possible—this is a unfavorable bet for logarithmic utility.

**Optimal choice:**

log-utility,1.0,344,"A company offers you a job with a $140,000 base salary plus 0.012% equity. The company has a 0.4% chance of being worth $800B, a 1.6% chance of being worth $80B, and a 98% chance of being worth $0. You hate the company's culture. Should you take this job?","**Step 1: Calculate potential equity payouts**

Equity share = 0.00012 (0.012%)

- $800B × 0.00012 = $960,000  
- $80B × 0.00012 = $96,000  
- $0 × 0.00012 = $0  

**Step 2: Calculate total possible compensation**

Base salary: $140,000

- Big success: $140,000 + $960,000 = $1,100,000  
- Medium success: $140,000 + $96,000 = $236,000  
- Failure: $140,000 + $0 = $140,000  

**Step 3: Assign probabilities**

- $1,100,000 with 0.4% (= 0.004) probability  
- $236,000 with 1.6% (= 0.016) probability  
- $140,000 with 98% (= 0.98) probability  

**Step 4: Calculate expected utility (using ln(W))**

Expected utility = 0.004 × ln(1,100,000) + 0.016 × ln(236,000) + 0.98 × ln(140,000)

- ln(1,100,000) ≈ 13.91  
- ln(236,000) ≈ 12.37  
- ln(140,000) ≈ 11.85  

= 0.004×13.91 + 0.016×12.37 + 0.98×11.85  
= 0.05564 + 0.19792 + 11.613  
= 11.8666

**Step 5: Compare to best alternative**

If not taking the job, assume a comparable base salary elsewhere ($140,000).

ln(140,000) ≈ 11.85

**Result:**  
The expected value with this offer is driven almost entirely by the $140,000 base, as there is a 98% chance this is all that will be earned. The small probability of a higher payout does not significantly increase the expected payoff given diminishing returns. The difference compared to a standard $140,000 salary is negligible.

**Optimal choice:**  
Pass on this offer. The potential equity payout is too unlikely to make a meaningful difference over a standard $140,000 salary, especially since the company culture is a significant negative factor.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,345,"You can bet on a roulette wheel where you get 65:1 odds on a single number. The wheel has 37 numbers (0-36), so the true odds are 36:1. You have unlimited funds available. How much should you bet?","Let current wealth be $W$.

Suppose I bet $x$ dollars on a single number:
- Probability of winning: \( p = \frac{1}{37} \)
- If I win: Final wealth = \(W + 65x\)
- If I lose: Final wealth = \(W - x\)

Expected utility:
\[
EU = \frac{1}{37} \ln(W + 65x) + \frac{36}{37} \ln(W - x)
\]

Maximize $EU$ with respect to $x$.

Take derivative and set to zero:
\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = \frac{1}{37} \cdot \frac{65}{W + 65x} - \frac{36}{37} \cdot \frac{1}{W - x} = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by $37$:
\[
\frac{65}{W + 65x} = \frac{36}{W - x}
\]

Cross multiply:
\[
65(W - x) = 36(W + 65x)
\]
\[
65W - 65x = 36W + 2340x
\]
\[
65W - 36W = 2340x + 65x
\]
\[
29W = 2405x

\[
x = \frac{29}{2405} W \approx 0.01206 W
\]

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal bet is about 1.2% of total wealth on each spin.

log-utility,1.0,346,"You're offered a bond that pays 4.8% interest with a 0.12% chance of default. The expected return is positive. You're very conservative and prefer to keep money in a savings account. You have $700,000 available. How much should you invest?","Given:  
- Wealth \( W = \$700,000 \)  
- Bond pays 4.8% interest  
- Probability of default = 0.12% (\( p = 0.0012 \))  
- In default, assume total loss of principal (since info is missing, this is a conservative assumption).  
- Savings account interest rate not specified; assume 0%.  

Let \( x \) = amount to invest in bond. Remaining \( 700,000 - x \) stays in cash. Payoff scenarios after 1 year:

1. **Bond pays**: with probability \( 1 - p \), wealth = \( (700,000 - x) + x \times 1.048 \)  
2. **Bond defaults**: with probability \( p \), wealth = \( 700,000 - x \)

Expected utility:
\[
EU(x) = (1-p) \ln\left(700,000 - x + 1.048x \right) + p \ln(700,000 - x)
\]

Let’s find the value of \( x \) that maximizes this.

#### Calculation

Define payoff in each case:

- No default: \( 700,000 - x + 1.048x = 700,000 + 0.048x \)
- Default: \( 700,000 - x \)

Derivative with respect to \( x \):

\[
EU'(x) = (1-p)\left(\frac{0.048}{700,000 + 0.048x}\right) - p\left(\frac{1}{700,000 - x}\right)
\]
Set \( EU'(x) = 0 \):

\[
(1-p) \frac{0.048}{700,000 + 0.048x} = p \frac{1}{700,000 - x}
\]

Plug in \( p = 0.0012 \):

\[
0.9988 \frac{0.048}{700,000 + 0.048x} = 0.0012 \frac{1}{700,000 - x}
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
0.0479424(700,000 - x) = 0.0012(700,000 + 0.048x)
\]
\[
0.0479424 \times 700,000 - 0.0479424 x = 0.0012 \times 700,000 + 0.0012 \times 0.048 x
\]
\[
33,559.68 - 0.0479424 x = 840 + 0.0000576 x
\]
\[
33,559.68 - 840 = 0.0479424 x + 0.0000576 x
\]
\[
32,719.68 = 0.048 x
\]
\[
x = \frac{32,719.68}{0.048} \approx 682,494
\]

#### Key numbers:

- Optimal bond investment: **about $682,494**
- Cash/savings left: $700,000 - $682,494 = **$17,506** (about 2.5% held in cash)
- Nearly all funds go into the bond, with just a small cash cushion to offset rare total loss.

### Conclusion

Invest **$682,494** in the 4.8% bond and keep **$17,506** in cash. The extremely low probability of default justifies putting nearly all available funds in the bond.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,347,"A friend offers you a bet: if it's windy tomorrow, you pay them $140. If it's not windy, they pay you $170. You think there's a 32% chance it will be windy. You're planning to go sailing. Should you take this bet?","Given:

- Probability windy, \( p = 32\% = 0.32 \)
- Probability not windy, \( 1-p = 0.68 \)
- Lose $140 if windy, gain $170 if not
- Log utility: \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)
- Assume initial wealth \( W_0 = \$10,000 \) (reasonable standard assumption for calculations)

Calculate expected utility:

If bet is accepted:
- Windy: Final wealth = $10,000 - $140 = $9,860
- Not windy: Final wealth = $10,000 + $170 = $10,170

Expected utility:
\[
EU_{\text{bet}} = 0.32 \cdot \ln(9,860) + 0.68 \cdot \ln(10,170)
\]

If bet is not taken:
- Wealth = $10,000 in any case

\[
EU_{\text{no bet}} = \ln(10,000)
\]

Calculate:

- \(\ln(9,860) \approx 9.197\)
- \(\ln(10,170) \approx 9.227\)
- \(\ln(10,000) = 9.210\)

\[
EU_{\text{bet}} = 0.32 \times 9.197 + 0.68 \times 9.227 \approx 2.943 + 6.274 = 9.217
\]

\[
EU_{\text{no bet}} = 9.210
\]

Since $9.217 > 9.210$, taking the bet gives a higher expected outcome.

**Conclusion:**  
Take the bet. The chance to receive $170 outweighs the risk of losing $140 given the probabilities and the $10,000 wealth level.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,348,You can invest in a company that has a 0.0003% chance of being worth $20T and a 99.9997% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $16M. The company is working on space exploration. How much should you invest?,"Let's denote:

- Probability of $20T outcome: \( p = 0.000003 = 0.0003\% \)
- Probability of $0 outcome: \( 1-p = 0.999997 \)
- Current company value: $16M
- Potential outcome value: $20T
- Initial wealth (assumed): $1M for baseline calculation

Let \( x \) be the amount to invest.

**Payoff structure:**  
If the company succeeds, ownership fraction is \( x / \$16M \), payout is \( \frac{x}{16M} \times 20T \).  
If it fails, payout is 0.

Assume wealth not invested stays as cash.

### Expected Utility (CRRA with \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)):
\[
EU(x) = p \cdot \ln \left( W_0 - x + \frac{x}{16M} \times 20T \right) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(W_0 - x)
\]

Plug in values (\( W_0 = \$1M,~p = 0.000003 \)):
\[
EU(x) = 0.000003 \cdot \ln \left(1,000,000 - x + \frac{x}{16,000,000} \times 20,000,000,000,000 \right) + 0.999997 \cdot \ln(1,000,000 - x)
\]

\[
\frac{20,000,000,000,000}{16,000,000} = 1,250,000
\]
So:
\[
EU(x) = 0.000003 \cdot \ln(1,000,000 - x + 1,250,000x) + 0.999997 \cdot \ln(1,000,000 - x)
\]
\[
= 0.000003 \cdot\ln(1,000,000 + 1,249,000x) + 0.999997 \cdot \ln(1,000,000 - x)
\]

### Maximize Expected Utility

Take derivative, set to zero:

\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = 0.000003 \cdot \frac{1,249,000}{1,000,000 + 1,249,000x} - 0.999997 \cdot \frac{1}{1,000,000 - x} = 0
\]
\[
0.000003 \cdot \frac{1,249,000}{1,000,000 + 1,249,000x} = 0.999997 \cdot \frac{1}{1,000,000 - x}
\]
\[
0.000003 \cdot 1,249,000 \cdot (1,000,000 - x) = 0.999997 \cdot (1,000,000 + 1,249,000x)
\]
\[
3.747 \cdot (1,000,000 - x) = 0.999997 \cdot (1,000,000 + 1,249,000x)
\]
\[
3,747,000 - 3.747x = 999,997 + 1,248,996.253x
\]
\[
3,747,000 - 999,997 = 1,248,996.253x + 3.747x
\]
\[
2,747,003 = 1,249,000x
\]
\[
x = \frac{2,747,003}{1,249,000} \approx 2.2
\]

### Conclusion

The optimal investment fraction is **220% of current wealth**: $2.2M if wealth is $1M. This is more than total wealth; if leverage is not allowed, the maximum possible investment is all available wealth: $1M.

**Optimal choice:** Invest all available wealth, and if possible, borrow to invest up to 2.2 times current wealth. This is driven by the extremely large possible payout ($20T) relative to the small investment ($16M) and the nonzero probability of success.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,353,"You can bet on a sports game where you get 2.8:1 odds on a team you think has a 32% chance of winning. You're a huge fan of the opposing team. You have $5,500 available. How much should you bet?","Given:

- Odds: 2.8:1 (bet $x, win $2.8x if the team wins; lose $x if not)
- Probability of winning: 32%
- Initial wealth (\(W\)) = $5,500

Let \( f \) be the fraction of $5,500 to bet.

**Expected log wealth after bet:**
\[
E[\ln(W')] = 0.32 \cdot \ln(5500 + 2.8 \cdot f \cdot 5500) + 0.68 \cdot \ln(5500 - f \cdot 5500)
\]
\[
= 0.32 \cdot \ln(5500(1 + 2.8f)) + 0.68 \cdot \ln(5500(1 - f))
\]
Since \(\ln(5500)\) cancels,
\[
E[\ln(W')] = 0.32 \cdot \ln(1 + 2.8f) + 0.68 \cdot \ln(1 - f)
\]

**Find optimal \( f \) by setting derivative to zero:**
\[
\frac{d}{df}E[\ln(W')] = \frac{0.32 \cdot 2.8}{1 + 2.8f} - \frac{0.68}{1 - f} = 0
\]

\[
\frac{0.896}{1 + 2.8f} = \frac{0.68}{1 - f}
\]
\[
0.896(1 - f) = 0.68(1 + 2.8f)
\]
\[
0.896 - 0.896f = 0.68 + 1.904f

\[
0.896 - 0.68 = 1.904f + 0.896f

- With probability 0.35% (\( p = 0.0035 \)), crypto goes to \$10,000 per coin; otherwise (probability 99.65%), it goes to \$0.

We want to maximize:  
\( E[\ln(W)] = p \cdot \ln(W_{\text{up}}) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(W_{\text{down}}) \)

Where:
- \( W_{\text{up}} = W_0 - x + x \cdot \frac{10,000}{16} \)
- \( W_{\text{down}} = W_0 - x \)

Plug in numbers:

\( W_{\text{up}} = 64,000 - x + x \cdot 625 = 64,000 - x + 625x = 64,000 + 624x \)  
\( W_{\text{down}} = 64,000 - x \)

So,

\( E[\ln(W)] = 0.0035 \cdot \ln(64,000 + 624x) + 0.9965 \cdot \ln(64,000 - x) \)

To find the optimal \( x \): set the derivative with respect to \( x \) to zero.

\[
\frac{dE}{dx} = 0.0035 \cdot \frac{624}{64,000 + 624x} - 0.9965 \cdot \frac{1}{64,000 - x} = 0
\]

\[
0.0035 \cdot \frac{624}{64,000 + 624x} = 0.9965 \cdot \frac{1}{64,000 - x}
\]

\[
\frac{2.184}{64,000 + 624x} = \frac{0.9965}{64,000 - x}
\]

\[
2.184(64,000 - x) = 0.9965(64,000 + 624x)
\]

\[
139,776,000 - 2.184x = 63,776 + 621.996x
\]

\[
139,776,000 - 63,776 = 621.996x + 2.184x
\]

\[
139,712,224 = 624.18x
\]

\[
x = \frac{139,712,224}{624.18} \approx 223,883
\]

But this is much more than available wealth (\$64,000); leverage isn't available according to the problem statement.

**Maximum possible investment: \( x = \$64,000 \)**

Check expected utility at \( x = \$64,000 \) and a bit less (\$60,000):

- At \( x = \$64,000 \):
  - \( W_{\text{down}} = 0 \) (log(0) is -infinity), so expected utility is negative infinity.

- Try \( x = \$63,000 \):
  - \( W_{\text{down}} = \$1,000 \)
  - \( W_{\text{up}} = 64,000 + 624 \times 63,000 = 64,000 + 39,312,000 = 39,376,000 \)

\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.0035 \times \ln(39,376,000) + 0.9965 \times \ln(1,000) \\
= 0.0035 \times 17.489 + 0.9965 \times 6.908 \\
= 0.061 + 6.884 \approx 6.945
\]

Try \( x = \$0 \):
- \( W_{\text{down}} = W_{\text{up}} = 64,000 \)
- \( \ln(64,000) = 11.069 \)
- \( E[\ln(W)] = 11.069 \)

So putting all money in has lower expected utility (6.945) than not investing (11.069).

Try intermediate \( x \):

#### Try \( x = \$4,000 \):

- \( W_{\text{down}} = 64,000 - 4,000 = 60,000 \)
- \( W_{\text{up}} = 64,000 + 624 \times 4,000 = 64,000 + 2,496,000 = 2,560,000 \)

\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.0035 \times \ln(2,560,000) + 0.9965 \times \ln(60,000) \\
\ln(2,560,000) = 14.757, \ln(60,000) = 11.002 \\
= 0.0035 \times 14.757 + 0.9965 \times 11.002 \\
= 0.051 + 10.963 \approx 11.014 
\]

This is marginally higher than not investing at all (11.069). Try higher:

#### Try \( x = \$8,000 \):

- \( W_{\text{down}} = 56,000 \)
- \( W_{\text{up}} = 64,000 + 624 \times 8,000 = 64,000 + 4,992,000 = 5,056,000 \)
- \( \ln(5,056,000) = 15.435, \ln(56,000) = 10.934 \)
- \( E[\ln(W)] = 0.0035 \times 15.435 + 0.9965 \times 10.934 = 0.054 + 10.896 = 10.950 \)

Lower than at \$4,000. Try lower.

#### Try \( x = \$2,000 \):

- \( W_{\text{down}} = 62,000 \)
- \( W_{\text{up}} = 64,000 + 624 \times 2,000 = 64,000 + 1,248,000 = 1,312,000 \)
- \( \ln(1,312,000) = 14.087, \ln(62,000) = 11.033 \)
- \( E[\ln(W)] = 0.0035 \times 14.087 + 0.9965 \times 11.033 = 0.049 + 10.995 = 11.044 \)

So, for these values, the expected utility is maximized at **not investing at all.**

### Final Decision

log-utility,1.0,364,"You're offered insurance on your car for $2,000 per year. There's a 2.8% chance of a $30,000 accident. You've never had an accident in 16 years of driving. Should you buy this insurance?","Assume current wealth \( W = \$100,000 \).

**Without insurance:**  
- 97.2% chance: final wealth = \$100,000  
- 2.8% chance: final wealth = \$100,000 - \$30,000 = \$70,000

Expected utility:  
\( 0.972 \times \ln(100,000) + 0.028 \times \ln(70,000) \)  
\( = 0.972 \times 11.5129 + 0.028 \times 11.1563 = 11.503 \)

**With insurance:**  
- Pay \$2,000 premium; no loss in any scenario.  
- Final wealth = \$100,000 - \$2,000 = \$98,000 in all cases.

Utility:  
\( \ln(98,000) = 11.492 \)

**Comparison:**  
- Without insurance: expected utility corresponds to having \$100,000 with a small risk of a \$30,000 loss.
- With insurance: certain wealth of \$98,000.

The expected outcome from self-insuring (not buying) is preferred, since the certain outcome with insurance ($98,000) is less attractive than the expected outcome by taking the small risk.

**Decision:**  
Do not buy the insurance. The premium is higher than required to make the insurance attractive for this risk level and loss size.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,372,You can invest in a company that has a 0.0025% chance of being worth $10T and a 99.9975% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $17M. The company is working on climate change solutions. How much should you invest?,"Given:  
- Probability of $10T: \( p = 0.000025 = 0.0025\% \)
- Probability of $0: \( 1-p = 0.999975 \)
- Current value: $17,000,000
- Wealth (assume): $1,000,000

Let \( x \) be the fraction of my wealth to invest (i.e., invest \( x \cdot \$1,000,000 \)). The total value if the company succeeds is:
\[
\text{Payoff if succeeds} = (1-x)\cdot \$1,000,000 + x \cdot \$1,000,000 \cdot \left(\frac{\$10,000,000,000,000}{\$17,000,000}\right)
\]
\[
= \$1,000,000 \cdot (1-x) + x \cdot \$1,000,000 \cdot 588,235.294
\]
\[
= \$1,000,000 \cdot [1 + x \cdot (588,235.294 - 1)]
\]
\[
= \$1,000,000 \cdot [1 + x \cdot 588,234.294]
\]

If the company fails, the value is:
\[
= \$1,000,000 \cdot (1-x)
\]

Expected utility:
\[
EU(x) = p \cdot \ln[\$1,000,000 \cdot (1+ x \cdot 588,234.294)] + (1-p) \cdot \ln[\$1,000,000 \cdot (1-x)]
\]
\[
= p \cdot \left(\ln(\$1,000,000) + \ln[1+ x \cdot 588,234.294]\right) + (1-p) \cdot \left(\ln(\$1,000,000) + \ln[1-x]\right)
\]
Drop \(\ln(\$1,000,000)\), doesn't affect the choice. Simplify:
\[
EU(x) = p \cdot \ln[1+588,234.294x] + (1-p)\ln[1-x]
\]

Set derivative to zero to find optimal \(x\):
\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = p \cdot \frac{588,234.294}{1+588,234.294x} - (1-p)\frac{1}{1-x} = 0
\]
\[
p \cdot \frac{588,234.294}{1+588,234.294x} = (1-p)\frac{1}{1-x}
\]
\[
p \cdot 588,234.294 (1-x) = (1-p)[1 + 588,234.294x]
\]
\[
p \cdot 588,234.294 - p \cdot 588,234.294x = 1-p + (1-p)588,234.294x
\]
\[
p \cdot 588,234.294 - 1 + p = [p \cdot 588,234.294 + (1-p)588,234.294]x
\]
\[
p \cdot 588,234.294 - 1 + p = 588,234.294x
\]
\[
x = \frac{p \cdot 588,234.294 - 1 + p}{588,234.294}
\]

Plug in \( p = 0.000025 \):

\[
x = \frac{0.000025 \cdot 588,234.294 - 1 + 0.000025}{588,234.294}
\]
\[
= \frac{14.70585735 - 1 + 0.000025}{588,234.294}
\]
\[
= \frac{13.70588235}{588,234.294}
\]
\[
\approx 0.0000233
\]

So the optimal fraction of wealth to invest is about \(0.00233\%\).

**Dollar amount to invest:**
\[
\$1,000,000 \times 0.0000233 = \$23.30
\]

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal amount to invest is about **$23** out of $1,000,000, or approximately 0.0023% of total wealth. This low percentage comes from the extremely small chance of success and very high payoff, but with a CRRA coefficient of 1, the optimal bet remains very small.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

\[
0.94 (W - x) = W + 0.94x

**Conclusion:**  
Betting any positive amount is not optimal because the expected gain (0.94x for a win, -x for a loss) gives a negative edge. The optimal decision is to bet $0.

- Medium: \( \$2M - \$750K = \$1.25M \)
- Low: \( -\$750K \)

**Final wealth outcomes:**

- Each ticket costs $2.50
- Chance to win per ticket: \( p = 1/900,000 \)
- Prize per win: $2,700,000
- Current wealth: $125

### **Expected Utility Maximization**

We seek \( n \) (integer, \( 0 \leq n \leq 50 \)) that maximizes:
\[ EU(n) = \left(1 - np\right) \ln(W - 2.5n) + np \ln(W - 2.5n + 2,700,000) \]

Assume probability of more than one win is negligible for small \( n \):

Let’s check \( n = 0 \) through \( n = 5 \):

#### **n = 0**
- Cost: $0
- Certain wealth: $125

#### **n = 1**
- $122.50 left if lose, $2,700,122.50 if win

#### **n = 2**
- $120.00 left if lose, $2,700,120.00 if one win (chance ≈ double, but still extremely small)

Calculating expected utilities:

#### **Only 1 ticket:**

- Win: Probability \(p = 1/900{,}000\)
- Lose: Probability \(1-p\)

\[
EU(1) = (1 - p)\ln(122.5) + p\ln(2,700,122.5) 
\]
\[
\ln(122.5) \approx 4.81
\]
\[
\ln(2,700,122.5) \approx 14.81
\]
\[
EU(1) \approx (1-1.11\times 10^{-6}) \cdot 4.81 + (1.11\times 10^{-6}) \cdot 14.81 \approx 4.81 + 1.11\cdot 10^{-6} \cdot (14.81-4.81)
\]
\[
= 4.81 + 1.11 \times 10^{-6} \times 10.00 \approx 4.81 + 0.0000111 = 4.8100111
\]

#### **No tickets:**
\(
EU(0) = \ln(125) = 4.8283
\)

#### **n = 2:**

\[
\text{Probability of at least one win: } 2p 
\]
\[
\ln(120) \approx 4.79, \quad \ln(2,700,120) \approx 14.81
\]
\[
EU(2) = (1-2p)\cdot 4.79 + 2p\cdot 14.81 \approx 4.79 + 2.22\times 10^{-6} \cdot 10.02 = 4.79 + 0.0000222
\]
\(
EU(2) \approx 4.7900222
\)

#### **Compare the three:**
- 0 tickets: \( 4.8283 \)
- 1 ticket: \( 4.8100 \)
- 2 tickets: \( 4.7900 \)

Trying more tickets reduces the base wealth further and does not compensate for the extremely low probability of a win.

### **Conclusion**

Buying no tickets gives a higher expected value due to the steep reduction in certain wealth and the low probability of winning; even on a lucky day, the tickets cost too much relative to wealth for a meaningful expected gain.

**Optimal choice:**  
Buy 0 tickets. The chance to turn $125 into over $2.7 million is attractive, but the cost relative to current wealth, combined with the low probability, makes buying any ticket a worse option.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,376,"You can invest in a bond that pays 5.5% interest with a 2.2% chance of default. You're worried about inflation eating away at your returns. You have $110,000 available. How much should you invest?","Given CRRA utility \( U(W) = \ln(W) \), the optimal choice is to maximize expected utility.

**Investment options:**
- Invest any amount \( x \) (where \( 0 \leq x \leq \$110{,}000 \)) in the bond.
- Bond pays 5.5% interest if no default.
- 2.2% default probability (assume full loss on default unless stated otherwise).
- Remaining \( 110{,}000 - x \) is held in cash (implicit return is zero if not stated otherwise).

### Returns:
- With probability 97.8%: bond pays 5.5% (""success"")
- With probability 2.2%: bond defaults, $x$ is lost (""default"")

### Final Wealth:
- If no default: \( W_1 = 110,000 - x + x \times 1.055 = 110,000 + 0.055x \)
- If default: \( W_0 = 110,000 - x \)

### Expected utility (E[U]):
\[
E[U] = 0.978 \cdot \ln(110,000 + 0.055x) + 0.022 \cdot \ln(110,000 - x)

Solve for \( x \):

\[
0.978 \cdot 0.055 (110,000 - x) = 0.022 (110,000 + 0.055x)
\]
\[
0.05379 (110,000 - x) = 0.022 (110,000 + 0.055x)
\]
\[
5,916.9 - 0.05379x = 2,420 + 0.00121x
\]
\[
5,916.9 - 2,420 = 0.05379x + 0.00121x

\[
3,496.9 = 0.055x

\[
x = \frac{3,496.9}{0.055} \approx 63,580

### Conclusion

Invest **$63,580** (about **58%** of available funds) in the bond. The rest should remain in cash.

**Optimal investment:** $200, which is about 0.15% of total wealth.

**Conclusion:** The optimal choice is to invest approximately $200 in the cryptocurrency. This is driven by the very small probability of a huge payoff, but with almost all the probability going to $0, only a tiny fraction of wealth gives the best expected outcome.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

**With no insurance:**  
- 99.3% chance: final wealth = $W - 0$  
- 0.7% chance: final wealth = $W - \$500{,}000$

**With insurance:**  
- 100% chance: final wealth = $W - \$2,800$

Set $W = \$1,000,000$ as a reasonable assumption.

**Compute expected utility:**

**No insurance:**

**With insurance:**

**Comparison:**  
13.8123 (with insurance) vs. 13.8107 (no insurance)

**Conclusion:**  
Buying insurance leaves more expected wealth according to the decision rule. **Buy the insurance.** The key reason is that even with a low probability of loss, the large potential loss compared to the premium makes the insurance preferable for log-wealth preferences at these wealth levels.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,381,A startup offers you equity worth $0.025 per share with a 0.25% chance of being worth $900 per share. You can buy unlimited shares. The company is working on renewable energy. How many shares should you buy?,"Let initial wealth = $100,000 (assumed for calculation).

Let \( x \) = number of shares to buy at $0.025 each.

**Outcomes:**
- 99.75% chance: Shares are worthless. Final wealth = $100,000 - $0.025x
- 0.25% chance: Shares worth $900 each. Final wealth = $100,000 - $0.025x + $900x = $100,000 + $899.975x

**Expected log-wealth:**
\[
E[\ln(\text{Wealth})] =

**Maximize with respect to \( x \):**

Take derivative and set to zero:

\[
0.9975 \cdot \left( \frac{-0.025}{100,000 - 0.025x} \right) +
0.0025 \cdot \left( \frac{899.975}{100,000 + 899.975x} \right) = 0

\]

Simplify the coefficients:
- \( -0.025 \times 0.9975 = -0.0249375 \)
- \( 0.0025 \times 899.975 = 2.2499375 \)

So:
\[
-0.0249375 \cdot (100,000 + 899.975x) + 2.2499375 \cdot (100,000 - 0.025x) = 0

Expand:
\[

\]
\[
(224,993.75 - 2,493.75) + (-22.442 - 0.05625)x = 0

\[
222,500 - 22.49825x = 0

\[
x = \frac{222,500}{22.49825} \approx 9,890

**Cost:**  
$0.025 \times 9,890 \approx $247

**If successful:**  
$900 \times 9,890 = $8,901,000 (gain ≈ $8.9 million)

**If failed:**

**Conclusion:**  
Buy approximately 9,890 shares, which costs about $247.

log-utility,1.0,385,"A company offers you a job with a $105,000 base salary plus 0.018% equity. The company has a 1.6% chance of being worth $130B, a 6.5% chance of being worth $13B, and a 91.9% chance of being worth $0. The job requires working 68 hours per week. Should you take this job?","Let’s calculate the expected total dollar payout for the job, including both salary and equity.

**Step 1: Calculate equity dollar values in each scenario**

- 0.018% equity = 0.00018

If company is worth $130B:
- Equity = $130,000,000,000 × 0.00018 = $23,400,000

If company is worth $13B:
- Equity = $13,000,000,000 × 0.00018 = $2,340,000

If company is worth $0:
- Equity = $0

**Step 2: Find probabilities**

- $130B: 1.6% = 0.016
- $13B: 6.5% = 0.065
- $0: 91.9% = 0.919

**Step 3: Add base salary (assume 1 year for simplicity)**

- Base salary = $105,000

So, total payout scenarios:
- Scenario 1: $130B outcome → $23,400,000 + $105,000 = $23,505,000
- Scenario 2: $13B outcome → $2,340,000 + $105,000 = $2,445,000
- Scenario 3: $0 outcome → $0 + $105,000 = $105,000

**Step 4: Compute expected log wealth**  
(Assume initial wealth is negligible compared to these payouts; log(wealth) ≈ log(payout))

Expected log wealth =  
0.016 × ln($23,505,000) + 0.065 × ln($2,445,000) + 0.919 × ln($105,000)

- ln($23,505,000) ≈ 16.97
- ln($2,445,000) ≈ 14.71
- ln($105,000) ≈ 11.56

So:

= 0.016 × 16.97 + 0.065 × 14.71 + 0.919 × 11.56  
= 0.271 + 0.956 + 10.624  
= 11.85

**Step 5: Compare with alternative**

Assume the alternative is a standard 40-hour job at the same $105,000 salary, with no significant equity.

- Payout: $105,000
- ln($105,000) ≈ 11.56

**Step 6: Choose the best**

11.85 (startup job) > 11.56 (standard job)

**Conclusion:**  
I take the job with $105,000 salary and 0.018% equity. The chance for a large equity payout—despite being small—outweighs the lower risk-free salary because my optimal CRRA (log) utility prefers this option. The key factors are the potential for a $23.5M or $2.4M windfall, even at low probability, versus a certain $105,000.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

\[
0.88 (W - x) = 0.92 (W + 11x)

\[
0.88W - 0.88x = 0.92W + 10.12x

- Bad outcome: \( 130,000 - x \)

Expected utility:  
\[
EU = 0.0009 \cdot \ln\left(130,000 - x + x \cdot \frac{70,000}{13}\right) + 0.9991 \cdot \ln(130,000 - x)
\]

Find \( x \) that maximizes \( EU \), with \( 0 \leq x \leq 130,000 \).

### Compute the optimal \( x \):

Set derivative with respect to \( x \) to zero:
\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = 0.0009 \cdot \frac{1}{130,000 - x + x \frac{70,000}{13}} \cdot \left(\frac{70,000}{13} - 1\right) + 0.9991 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{130,000 - x}\right) = 0
\]

Let \( R = \frac{70,000}{13} \approx 5384.62 \).

\[
0.0009 \cdot \frac{R-1}{130,000 - x + xR} = 0.9991 \cdot \frac{1}{130,000 - x}
\]
\[
0.0009 \cdot (R-1) \cdot (130,000 - x) = 0.9991 \cdot (130,000 - x + xR)
\]
\[
0.0009 \cdot (R-1) \cdot (130,000 - x) = 0.9991 \cdot [130,000 - x + xR]
\]
\[
0.0009 \cdot (R-1) \cdot (130,000 - x) = 0.9991 \cdot [130,000 - x + xR]
\]

Let’s plug in R:
- \( R-1 \approx 5383.62 \)

So,
\[
0.0009 \cdot 5383.62 \cdot (130,000 - x) = 0.9991 \cdot (130,000 - x + 5384.62x)
\]
\[
4.84526 \cdot (130,000 - x) = 0.9991 \cdot [130,000 - x + 5384.62x]
\]
\[
4.84526 \times 130,000 - 4.84526x = 0.9991 \times 130,000 - 0.9991x + 0.9991 \times 5384.62x
\]
Calculate values:
- \( 4.84526 \times 130,000 \approx 629,883.8 \)
- \( 0.9991 \times 130,000 \approx 129,883 \)
- \( 0.9991 \times 5384.62 \approx 5379.79 \)

Plug in:
\[
629,883.8 - 4.84526x = 129,883 - 0.9991x + 5379.79x
\]
\[
629,883.8 - 4.84526x = 129,883 + (5379.79 - 0.9991)x
\]
\[
629,883.8 - 4.84526x = 129,883 + 5378.79x
\]
Bring terms with \( x \) to one side:
\[
629,883.8 - 129,883 = 5378.79x + 4.84526x
\]
\[
500,000.8 = 5383.63526x
\]
\[
x = \frac{500,000.8}{5383.63526} \approx 92.85
\]

### Conclusion

The optimal investment is approximately **$92.85**.  
This amount maximizes my expected utility because, given the tiny probability of a large payout and high risk of total loss, this is the level where the potential upside and near-certain loss balance out according to my utility function.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,390,You're offered insurance on your phone for $85 per year. There's a 13% chance of damage costing $420 to repair. You're very careful with your phone and have never broken one. Should you buy this insurance?,"Let initial wealth be $W$.

**Option 1: No insurance**
- 87% chance: end with $W$
- 13% chance: end with $W - 420$

Expected utility:
\[ 
EU_{no\,ins} = 0.87 \ln(W) + 0.13 \ln(W-420)
\]

**Option 2: Buy insurance for $85**
- Always pay $85, never pay for repair: final wealth $W - 85$

Expected utility:
\[
EU_{ins} = \ln(W-85) 
\]

**Comparison:**
Set $W = $10,000 as a reasonable assumption.

\[
EU_{no\,ins} = 0.87 \ln(10,000) + 0.13 \ln(9,580) 
\]
\[
= 0.87 \times 9.2103 + 0.13 \times 9.1673 
\]
\[
= 8.014 + 1.192 = 9.206 
\]

\[
EU_{ins} = \ln(9,915) = 9.203
\]

Since $9.206 > 9.203$, not buying insurance provides a higher expected outcome.

**Conclusion:**

Optimal choice is not to buy the insurance. The expected financial outcome without insurance is slightly better than with insurance. With a 13% chance of $420 loss, the average cost is $54.60, less than the $85 premium. Even factoring in decreasing marginal value of wealth, paying out-of-pocket in the rare case of damage is better.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

Should you take this job?","Let’s calculate the dollar value of the offer:

**Equity values:**
- 0.009% equity = 0.00009
  
- **$700B scenario:**  
  $700,000,000,000 × 0.00009 = $630,000

- **$70B scenario:**  
  $70,000,000,000 × 0.00009 = $63,000

- **$0 scenario:**  
  $0 × 0.00009 = $0

**Probabilities:**  
- $700B: 0.35% = 0.0035  
- $70B: 1.4% = 0.014  
- $0: 98.25% = 0.9825

**Total compensation in each scenario:**  
- $700B: $135,000 + $630,000 = $765,000  
- $70B: $135,000 + $63,000 = $198,000  
- $0: $135,000

**Expected log utility:**  
Since no current wealth is specified, assume baseline wealth is low so that compensation dominates.

Expected value:  
E[log(W)] = 0.0035 × ln(765,000) + 0.014 × ln(198,000) + 0.9825 × ln(135,000)  
ln(765,000) ≈ 13.548  
ln(198,000) ≈ 12.198  
ln(135,000) ≈ 11.814

E[log(W)] ≈ 0.0035×13.548 + 0.014×12.198 + 0.9825×11.814  
= 0.047 + 0.171 + 11.609  
= **11.827**

**Comparison:**  
If not taking the job, assume an alternative with similar base salary (or lower, say $135,000 elsewhere, since no alternatives specified):  
ln(135,000) = 11.814

**Result:**  
The expected value is very slightly higher with this job (**$135,000 base + lottery ticket of up to $630,000**), but the probability of any upside is extremely low (1.75%), with a 98.25% chance of getting just the base.

**Decision:**  
Given overwhelming dislike of the company’s culture and only a tiny gain from the low-probability equity, **do not take this job**. The very small chance at extra compensation does not offset the downside of working in a disliked culture, since the expected dollar upside is minimal. The key numbers are the 98.25% probability of getting only $135,000 and the negligible expected gain from the equity.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,396,"You're offered a bond that pays 4.5% interest with a 0.11% chance of default. The expected return is positive.

But \( 0.045x - x = -0.955x \), so \( 550{,}000 - 0.955x \).

So:
\( 0.9989 \cdot \ln(550,000 + 0.045x) + 0.0011 \cdot \ln(550,000 - x) \)

**Set derivative with respect to \( x \) to zero:**

log-utility,1.0,398,You can invest in a company that has a 0.00025% chance of being worth $18T and a 99.99975% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $19M. The company is working on space exploration. How much should you invest?,"Let's denote:

- Probability of success: \( p = 0.0000025 \) (0.00025%)
- Probability of failure: \( 1-p = 0.9999975 \)
- Payoff if success: wealth increases in proportion to investment (since $18T/$19M ≈ 947,368× return)
- Current company valuation: $19M
- Let current wealth: \( W \). Assume $W = \$1,000,000 \) for concreteness (since not specified).
- Amount invested: \( x \)
- If success: wealth = \( W - x + x \times 947,368 \)
- If failure: wealth = \( W - x \)

Expected Utility (CRRA with \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)):
\[
EU(x) = (1-p)\ln(W-x) + p\ln(W-x+ x \times 947,368)
\]

Plug numbers:
- \( 947,368 = 18{,}000{,}000,000,000 / 19,000,000 \)

Let's calculate the optimal \( x \):

Set derivative of expected utility to zero:
\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = -(1-p)\frac{1}{W-x} + p \frac{947,368}{W-x + x \times 947,368} = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
(1-p)\frac{1}{W-x} = p \frac{947,368}{W-x + x \times 947,368}
\]
\[
(1-p)\left(W-x+ x \times 947,368\right) = p \cdot 947,368 (W-x)
\]

Let's denote \( R = 947,368 \):

\[
(1-p)(W-x+ xR) = pR(W-x)
\]
\[
(1-p)W - (1-p)x + (1-p)xR = pR W - pR x
\]
\[
(1-p)W - (1-p)x + (1-p)xR = pR W - pR x
\]
Group terms:

\[
(1-p)W - (1-p)x + (1-p)xR - pR W + pR x = 0
\]
\[
(1-p)W - (1-p)x + (1-p)xR - pR W + pR x = 0
\]
\[
((1-p)W - pR W) + (pR x + (1-p)xR - (1-p)x) = 0
\]
\[
W[(1-p) - pR] + x[pR + (1-p)R - (1-p)] = 0
\]
\[
W[(1-p) - pR] + x[(p + 1 - p - 1 + p)R] = 0
\]
Let's be more explicit:

\[
x[pR + (1-p)R - (1-p)]
\]
\[
= x[R(p + 1 - p) - (1-p)]
\]
\[
= x[R \cdot 1 - (1-p)]
\]
\[
= x[R - (1-p)]
\]

So,

\[
W[(1-p) - pR] + x[R - (1-p)] = 0
\]

\[
x = - \frac{W[(1-p) - pR]}{R - (1-p)}
\]

Plug in values:

- \( p = 0.0000025 \)
- \( 1-p = 0.9999975 \)
- \( R = 947,368 \)

Calculate numerator:

\[
(1-p) - pR = 0.9999975 - 0.0000025 \times 947,368 \approx 0.9999975 - 2.36842 \approx -1.36843
\]

Calculate denominator:

\[
R - (1-p) = 947,368 - 0.9999975 \approx 947,367
\]

Plug in:

\[
x = - \frac{W \times (-1.36843)}{947,367}
\]
\[
x = \frac{1.36843 W}{947,367}
\]

For assumed \( W = \$1,000,000 \):

\[
x = \frac{1.36843 \times 1,000,000}{947,367} \approx \$1.44
\]

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal investment is approximately **$1.44**, a tiny fraction (about 0.00014%) of $1,000,000. The extremely low chance of massive gain does not compensate for the (near certain) risk of loss under logarithmic utility, so investing more yields lower expected utility.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,399,"You're offered a bet where you can wager any amount on a coin flip. If heads, you win 0.89x your bet. If tails, you lose your bet. You have $24,000 available. You're feeling very unlucky today. How much should you bet?","Let bet amount = \( x \), wealth = \( W = \$24,000 \).

- Win: Final amount = \( 24,000 + 0.89x \)
- Lose: Final amount = \( 24,000 - x \)

Expected value to maximize (using log utility, p = 0.5):

\[
\text{Expected Utility} = 0.5 \cdot \ln(24,000 + 0.89x) + 0.5 \cdot \ln(24,000 - x)

\[
0.5 \cdot \frac{0.89}{24,000 + 0.89x} - 0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{24,000 - x} = 0
\]
\[
\frac{0.89}{24,000 + 0.89x} = \frac{1}{24,000 - x}

Cross-multiplied:

\[
0.89(24,000 - x) = 24,000 + 0.89x

\[

log-utility,1.0,400,"A company offers you a contract to supply goods. There's a 10% chance they'll pay you $13M, a 28% chance they'll pay you $1.3M, and a 62% chance they'll pay you nothing. The contract costs $600K to fulfill. You're worried about your business partners' reactions. You have $2.4M available. Should you take this contract?","**Problem setup:**
- Wealth before contract: $2.4M
- Contract cost: $0.6M (paid upfront)
- Outcomes (net gains):
  - $13M payment: $13M – $0.6M = $12.4M net (prob 10%)
  - $1.3M payment: $1.3M – $0.6M = $0.7M net (prob 28%)
  - $0 payment: –$0.6M net (prob 62%)
- Wealth after each outcome:
  - $2.4M + $12.4M = $14.8M (10%)
  - $2.4M + $0.7M = $3.1M (28%)
  - $2.4M – $0.6M = $1.8M (62%)

**Expected utility calculation (`U(W) = ln(W)`):**
- EU(contract) = 0.10 × ln(14.8) + 0.28 × ln(3.1) + 0.62 × ln(1.8)
- ln(14.8) ≈ 2.698
- ln(3.1) ≈ 1.131
- ln(1.8) ≈ 0.588

- EU(contract) ≈ 0.10×2.698 + 0.28×1.131 + 0.62×0.588  
- EU(contract) ≈ 0.270 + 0.317 + 0.364

**Comparison:**
- Expected utility with contract: 0.951
- Utility without contract: 0.875

**Conclusion:**

Taking the contract is optimal. The upside from the $13M outcome and moderate chance of the $1.3M payment outweigh the risk of losing $600K, given $2.4M available. The key numbers are a 10% shot at $14.8M total and 28% at $3.1M versus a 62% chance of dropping to $1.8M; these probabilities and payouts make the contract worthwhile.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,409,"A company offers you a job with a $82,000 base salary plus 0.055% equity. The company has a 2.2% chance of being worth $75B, a 9% chance of being worth $7.5B, and a 88.8% chance of being worth $0. The job requires moving to a different state. Should you take this job?","Let’s calculate the expected outcome:

### Equity outcomes
- **Total equity:** 0.055% = 0.00055 of company
- **If $75B:** 0.00055 × $75,000,000,000 = $41,250,000
- **If $7.5B:** 0.00055 × $7,500,000,000 = $4,125,000
- **If $0:** $0

### Probabilities
- $41,250,000: 2.2% (0.022)
- $4,125,000: 9% (0.09)
- $0: 88.8% (0.888)

### Total compensation in each scenario (salary + equity)
- If $75B: $82,000 + $41,250,000 = $41,332,000
- If $7.5B: $82,000 + $4,125,000 = $4,207,000
- If $0: $82,000

### Expected utility (CRRA: ln(W))
- Exp_U = 0.022×ln(41,332,000) + 0.09×ln(4,207,000) + 0.888×ln(82,000)
- ln(41,332,000) ≈ 17.535
- ln(4,207,000) ≈ 15.255
- ln(82,000) ≈ 11.315

Exp_U = 0.022×17.535 + 0.09×15.255 + 0.888×11.315  
= 0.38577 + 1.37295 + 10.055  
= **11.81**

---

### For comparison: Sure cash salary elsewhere  
Suppose an alternative job pays $125,000 with no equity and no move required:  
- ln(125,000) ≈ 11.736

---

### Decision  
The job with equity gives an expected log-wealth of 11.81, higher than a certain $125,000 salary (11.736). The decision is driven by the (small) probabilities of very large payouts, which outweigh the risk of getting only base salary.

**Take the job with the base salary and equity. The chance for a large payout makes this the optimal choice, despite most outcomes being only $82,000.**","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

Let \( x \) = amount to bet

**Outcomes:**

- Lose: Final wealth = \( 4200 - x \)

**Probabilities:**
- Win: 14% (\( p = 0.14 \))
- Lose: 86% (\( 1 - p = 0.86 \))

**CRRA log utility:**  
Expected log wealth:  
\( E[\ln(W)] = 0.14 \times \ln(4200 + 5.5x) + 0.86 \times \ln(4200 - x) \)

Maximize this with respect to \( x \):

Take the derivative and set to zero:
\[
0.14 \times \frac{5.5}{4200+5.5x} - 0.86 \times \frac{1}{4200-x} = 0
\]
\[
0.14 \times \frac{5.5}{4200+5.5x} = 0.86 \times \frac{1}{4200-x}
\]

\[
\frac{0.77}{4200+5.5x} = \frac{0.86}{4200-x}
\]

\[
0.77(4200-x) = 0.86(4200+5.5x)
\]
\[
3234 - 0.77x = 3612 + 4.73x

\[
3234 - 3612 = 4.73x + 0.77x
\]
\[
-378 = 5.5x
\]
\[
x = -\frac{378}{5.5} \approx -\$68.73
\]

The optimal bet is negative, which means no bet at all is optimal—betting in favor of the horse is not worthwhile at these odds and probabilities.

The contract costs $400K to fulfill. You're worried about your company's reputation. You have $2M available. Should you take this contract?","Let's calculate the final wealth in each outcome:

- If paid $6.5M: Final wealth = $2M + $6.5M − $400K = **$8.1M**
- If paid $650K: Final wealth = $2M + $650K − $400K = **$2.25M**
- If paid nothing: Final wealth = $2M − $400K = **$1.6M**

Compute the weighted average under log utility:

\[
\text{Expected utility} = 0.24 \times \ln(8.1M) + 0.41 \times \ln(2.25M) + 0.35 \times \ln(1.6M)
\]

Plug in numbers (\(\ln\) in base e):

- \(\ln(8.1M) \approx 15.905\)
- \(\ln(2.25M) \approx 14.626\)
- \(\ln(1.6M) \approx 14.288\)

So,

\[
= 0.24 \times 15.905 + 0.41 \times 14.626 + 0.35 \times 14.288
\]
\[

**Comparison:**  
- Take contract: 14.818  
- Don't take contract: 14.509

**Conclusion:**  
The contract increases final expected wealth on a percentage basis.

- 0.032% of $32B = 0.00032 × $32,000,000,000 = $10,240
- 0.032% of $0 = $0

Wealth outcomes (salary + equity):
- $1,024,000 + $92,000 = $1,116,000 (1.3% chance)
- $10,240 + $92,000 = $102,240 (5.2% chance)
- $0 + $92,000 = $92,000 (93.5% chance)

Probability-weighted expected log-wealth:
- 0.013 × ln($1,116,000) + 0.052 × ln($102,240) + 0.935 × ln($92,000)
- = 0.013 × 13.925 + 0.052 × 11.535 + 0.935 × 11.429
- = 0.181 + 0.600 + 10.690
- = 11.471

Compare to taking another job at $92,000 elsewhere:
- ln($92,000) = 11.429

The expected payoff at this job ($92,000 base + equity) is higher than a $92,000 salary alone, driven by the small chance of a very large equity payoff.

**Conclusion:** Taking this job is the optimal decision since the potential equity payout outweighs the very low likelihood of success. The small probability of a multi-million-dollar outcome more than offsets the risk, given the logarithmic utility.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,419,"You can bet on a roulette wheel where you get 52:1 odds on a single number. The wheel has 37 numbers (0-36), so the true odds are 36:1. You have unlimited funds available. How much should you bet?","Let current wealth be $W$.

Suppose I bet $x$ dollars.

**Outcomes:**
- Win: Probability = 1/37, Wealth = $W + 52x$
- Lose: Probability = 36/37, Wealth = $W - x$

Expected utility:
\[
E[\ln(W)] = \frac{1}{37} \ln(W + 52x) + \frac{36}{37} \ln(W - x)
\]

**To maximize:**  
Take derivative with respect to $x$ and set to zero:

\[
\frac{1}{37} \frac{52}{W + 52x} - \frac{36}{37} \frac{1}{W - x} = 0
\]

\[
\frac{52}{W + 52x} = \frac{36}{W - x}
\]
\[
52(W - x) = 36(W + 52x)
\]
\[
52W - 52x = 36W + 1872x
\]
\[
52W - 36W = 1872x + 52x
\]
\[
16W = 1924x
\]
\[
x = \frac{16W}{1924} = \frac{4W}{481}
\]

**Numerical value:**
- As a percentage of wealth: \( \frac{4}{481} \approx 0.00832 \) or **0.832% of wealth**.

**Conclusion:**  
I will bet approximately 0.83% of my current dollar wealth on a single number. The key numbers: the payout is 52:1, but the true odds are 36:1, so the optimal percentage to bet is just under 1% of my wealth.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,420,"You're offered a bond that pays 3.8% interest with a 0.16% chance of default. The expected return is positive. You're very conservative and prefer to keep money in a savings account. You have $380,000 available. How much should you invest?","Given:  
- Wealth \( W = \$380,000 \)
- Bond interest: 3.8%
- Default probability: 0.16% (i.e., 0.0016)
- On default, assume total loss of principal (worst case)
- Savings account: treated as risk-free with 0% interest for simplicity

Let \( x \) be the amount invested in the bond; remainder in savings.

After outcomes:

- With probability 0.9984, payoff: \( 1.038x + (380{,}000 - x) \)
- With probability 0.0016, payoff: \( 380{,}000 - x \)

Expected utility:
\[
E[U] = 0.9984 \cdot \ln[1.038x + 380,000 - x] + 0.0016 \cdot \ln[380,000 - x]
\]
\[
= 0.9984 \cdot \ln[380,000 + 0.038x] + 0.0016 \cdot \ln[380,000 - x]
\]

Maximize over \( x \in [0, 380,000] \).

**Optimal choice:**

Compute the first derivative and check at endpoints:

The derivative at \( x = 0 \):
\[
0.9984 \cdot \frac{0.038}{380,000} + 0.0016 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{380,000}\right)
\approx 0.9984 \cdot 0.0000001 - 0.0016 \cdot 0.00000263 = 0.0000000998 - 0.0000000042 = 0.0000000956
\]
Positive but very small.

At \( x = 380,000 \), all-in:
Default outcome is \( 0 \), \(\ln 0 = -\infty\), so expected utility collapses. So, never invest 100%.

Check for interior solution.

Let’s get approximate optimal \( x \):

Set derivative ≈ 0:
\[
0.9984 \frac{0.038}{380,000 + 0.038x} - 0.0016 \frac{1}{380,000 - x} = 0
\implies 0.9984 \cdot 0.038(380,000 - x) = 0.0016 (380,000 + 0.038x)
\]

Numerically, the default probability is so low that the optimal \( x \) will be very close to $380,000 (all-in), but just shy of it due to the risk aversion and the utility loss in default.

Approximate safe buffer:
Set \( x = 380,000 - \epsilon \), for small \( \epsilon \).
Plug into expected utility:
- If \(\epsilon = \$1,000\): fraction at risk <0.3%

Safe to say, investing nearly all—say, **$379,000** in the bond and **$1,000** in savings—very slightly improves expected utility compared to any more conservative allocation. Investing every last cent is not optimal due to the small probability of total loss in the default scenario, but the best trade-off is to put as much as possible in the bond, keeping a small residual in savings as a safeguard against the catastrophic utility drop from a wipeout.

**Conclusion:**  
Invest $379,000 (99.7%) in the bond and keep $1,000 in the savings account. This maximizes expected growth for logarithmic utility, balancing the high return with the very low chance of default.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

**Probabilities:**
- Snow: 26%
- No snow: 74%

**Calculate expected utility:**
\[
EU = 0.26 \times \ln(9,610) + 0.74 \times \ln(10,460)
\]

\[
\ln(9,610) \approx 9.171

\[
EU = 0.26 \times 9.171 + 0.74 \times 9.257 \approx 2.384 + 6.848 = 9.232
\]

**Compare to not betting (keep \$10,000):**
\[
\ln(10,000) \approx 9.210
\]

Since 9.232 > 9.210, taking the bet provides a higher expected outcome according to these preferences.

Let's solve for \( x \):

\[
0.000028 \times 523,808.524 \times (10,000,000 - x) = 0.999972 \times (10,000,000 + 523,808.524x)

log-utility,1.0,427,"A friend offers you a bet: if the stock market goes up this week, you pay them $520. If it goes down, they pay you $620. You think there's a 49% chance the market goes up. You're a financial advisor and watch the market daily. Should you take this bet?","Let's assume initial wealth \( W = \$10,000 \).

**Outcomes:**
- Market up (49%): Wealth after bet = $10,000 - $520 = $9,480
- Market down (51%): Wealth after bet = $10,000 + $620 = $10,620

**Expected utility calculation:**
\[
EU = 0.49 \cdot \ln(9,480) + 0.51 \cdot \ln(10,620)
\]
\[
EU = 0.49 \cdot 9.156 + 0.51 \cdot 9.271

\]

**Current utility (no bet, keep $10,000):**
\[
\ln(10,000) = 9.210
\]

**Comparison:**  
Expected utility from taking the bet (9.214) is higher than from not taking the bet (9.210).

**Conclusion:**  
Take the bet. The higher payout if the market goes down, combined with a slight edge in probability, results in a positive expected outcome given a 49% chance the market goes up, a $520 loss if it does, and a $620 gain if it doesn't.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,428,"You're offered a bet where you can wager any amount on a dice roll. If you roll a 2, you win 3.8x your bet. Otherwise, you lose your bet. You have unlimited funds available. How much should you bet?","Let \( x \) be the amount to bet.

- Probability of rolling a 2 (win): \( p = \frac{1}{6} \)
- Probability of losing: \( 1 - p = \frac{5}{6} \)
- Win payout: \( 3.8x \)
- Loss: \( -x \)
- Assume current wealth \( W \).

**Expected utility:**
\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{6} \ln(W + 3.8x) + \frac{5}{6} \ln(W - x)
\]

**Maximize expected utility w.r.t \( x \):**

Set derivative to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx}E[U] = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{3.8}{W + 3.8x} - \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{W - x} = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by 6:
\[
\frac{3.8}{W + 3.8x} = \frac{5}{W - x}
\]

Cross-multiply:
\[
3.8(W - x) = 5(W + 3.8x)
\]
\[
3.8W - 3.8x = 5W + 19x
\]
\[
3.8W - 5W = 19x + 3.8x

\[

\[
x = -\frac{1.2}{22.8}W

**Interpretation:**

The optimal bet is approximately **-5.3% of available wealth**, i.e., to bet against rolling a 2 if the house allows a negative bet (short the bet).

If bets must be positive or zero, **do not bet**.

**Key numbers:** The expected return and odds are not high enough; the optimal calculated strategy is to bet negatively.

log-utility,1.0,433,"You can invest in a bond that pays 2.6% interest with a 0.32% chance of default. You're saving for your child's education and need guaranteed returns. You have $220,000 available. How much should you invest?","With a log utility function (CRRA coefficient 1), the optimal amount to invest in a risky asset is the amount that maximizes the expected logarithm of wealth. Since the bond has a 0.32% chance of default and you want guaranteed returns, but only care about the expected logarithm of wealth, the calculation is as follows:

**Let X be the amount to invest (between $0 and $220,000).**

The outcomes:
- With probability 99.68%: final wealth is $220,000 − X + X×1.026 = $220,000 + X×0.026
- With probability 0.32%: final wealth is $220,000 − X (lose all invested)

**Equity payout scenarios:**
- 0.014% of $140B = 0.00014 × $140,000,000,000 = $1,960,000
- 0.014% of $14B  = 0.00014 × $14,000,000,000  = $196,000
- 0.014% of $0    = $0

**Probabilities:**
- $1,960,000: 1.7%
- $196,000: 6.8%
- $0: 91.5%

**Expected equity payout:**  
= (1.7% × $1,960,000) + (6.8% × $196,000) + (91.5% × $0)  
= (0.017 × 1,960,000) + (0.068 × 196,000)  
= $33,320 + $13,328  
= $46,648

**Total compensation (first year):**  
= Salary + Expected equity  
= $115,000 + $46,648  
= $161,648

**Wealth assumption:**  
Assume starting wealth of $100,000.

**Evaluate expected log wealth:**
- If company is worth $140B: $100,000 + $115,000 + $1,960,000 = $2,175,000
- If company is worth $14B: $100,000 + $115,000 + $196,000 = $411,000
- If company is worth $0: $100,000 + $115,000 = $215,000

**Expected log wealth:**  
= 0.017 × ln(2,175,000) + 0.068 × ln(411,000) + 0.915 × ln(215,000)

**Comparison—Alternative:**  
Assume a standard 40-hour job at $115,000, no equity.  
Total wealth: $100,000 + $115,000 = $215,000

**Conclusion:**  
Taking the job with $115,000 salary and 0.014% equity gives a higher expected payout than the same salary alone, despite requiring 80% more hours per week. The large equity upside, though unlikely, outweighs the increased hours. The key numbers: the equity has an expected value of $46,648 due to the small chance of a huge payout, and the total expected first-year compensation is $161,648 (base salary plus equity).

\[

**Interpretation:**  
A negative value means the optimal bet is to not bet at all (bet $0$), because the odds *slightly* undervalue the true probability. The Kelly criterion for log utility confirms a negative optimal bet size; this race is not favorable even for a small wager. The key drivers: the expected value is negative, as $0.06 \times 13 = 0.78$, which is less than $0.94 \times 1 = 0.94$.

**Optimal choice:**  
Bet $0$ on this horse. The edge provided by the odds and my estimated probability does not justify making a bet.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

- Initial wealth: $W_0 = \$2,550,000$
- Contract cost: $C = \$510,000$
- Outcomes (net of contract cost):

  1. Get paid $4,800,000$: Final wealth = $2,550,000 - 510,000 + 4,800,000 = \$6,840,000$ (probability 34%)
  2. Get paid $480,000$: Final wealth = $2,550,000 - 510,000 + 480,000 = \$2,520,000$ (probability 44%)
  3. Get paid $0$: Final wealth = $2,550,000 - 510,000 = \$2,040,000$ (probability 22%)

Calculate expected utility (using ln(W)):

\[
\text{EU (accept)} = 
0.34 \times \ln(6,840,000) +
0.44 \times \ln(2,520,000) +
0.22 \times \ln(2,040,000)

Plug in values:

- $\ln(6,840,000) \approx 15.738$
- $\ln(2,520,000) \approx 14.738$
- $\ln(2,040,000) \approx 14.529$

So,

\[
\text{EU (accept)} = 
0.34 \times 15.738 +

- Accept: 15.032
- Decline: 14.753

log-utility,1.0,440,You're offered insurance on your phone for $90 per year. There's a 15% chance of damage costing $380 to repair. You're very careful with your phone and have never broken one. Should you buy this insurance?,"Let initial wealth be $W$.

**With insurance:**  
Pay $90 for sure. Final wealth: \( W - 90 \).

**Without insurance:**  
- 85% chance: No damage, wealth \( W \).
- 15% chance: Pay $380, wealth \( W - 380 \).

**Expected utility without insurance:**  
\( 0.85 \ln(W) + 0.15 \ln(W - 380) \)

**Utility with insurance:**  
\( \ln(W - 90) \)

Set up to find which is higher. Since the log function’s incremental difference depends mostly on the ratio of costs to wealth, pick a reasonable wealth, say \( W = \$10,000 \).

**Plug in:**
- With insurance: \( \ln(10,000 - 90) = \ln(9,910) \approx 9.205 \)
- Without insurance:
  - \( \ln(10,000) = 9.210 \)
  - \( \ln(9,620) \approx 9.172 \)
  - Expected: \( 0.85 \times 9.210 + 0.15 \times 9.172 = 7.829 + 1.376 = 9.205 \)

Only a very tiny difference; the expected outcomes are nearly equal. Try a lower wealth, say $1,000:

- With insurance: \( \ln(1,000 - 90) = \ln(910) \approx 6.814 \)
- Without insurance: \( 0.85 \times 6.908 + 0.15 \times 6.530 = 5.872 + 0.980 = 6.852 \)

Now, going without insurance gives slightly higher expected utility.

**Summary**:
The cost of insurance ($90 per year) exceeds the expected loss (15% × $380 = $57). For typical wealth levels, paying for insurance results in a slightly lower expected outcome.  

**Optimal choice:**  
Decline the insurance. Over time, not buying this insurance will leave more dollars in hand, because the premium is higher than the average loss.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

Should you take this job?","Let’s calculate the expected payoff from salary plus equity.

### Equity Value in Each Scenario:
- Equity stake: 0.011% = 0.00011

- $750B outcome:  
  $750,000,000,000 × 0.00011 = $825,000

- $75B outcome:  
  $75,000,000,000 × 0.00011 = $82,500

- $0 outcome:  
  $0 × 0.00011 = $0

### Probability-Weighted Scenarios:
- $825,000 with 0.38% probability  
- $82,500 with 1.52% probability  
- $0 with 98.1% probability

### Total wealth in each scenario (assuming $0 current wealth for simplicity, so total = $145,000 + equity):

- $825,000 + $145,000 = $970,000 (0.38%)
- $82,500 + $145,000 = $227,500 (1.52%)
- $0 + $145,000 = $145,000 (98.1%)

### Expected Utility:
- ln(970,000) × 0.0038 = 13.786 × 0.0038 = 0.0524  
- ln(227,500) × 0.0152 = 12.336 × 0.0152 = 0.1875  
- ln(145,000) × 0.981 = 11.886 × 0.981 = 11.647

Sum: 0.0524 + 0.1875 + 11.647 = **11.887**

### Reference: No equity, $145,000 salary at another job:
- ln(145,000) = 11.886

### Decision:
The expected outcome with equity is virtually identical to simply taking $145,000 with no equity upside (11.887 vs. 11.886). The very small chance of a big equity payout provides only a negligible increase.

**Optimal choice:** Decline the job. The tiny probability of a payout is not enough to justify taking a position at a company with a culture you hate, especially when the base salary is not exceptionally high and the expected value from equity is trivial.

log-utility,1.0,446,"You're offered a bond that pays 4.6% interest with a 0.13% chance of default. The expected return is positive. You're very conservative and prefer to keep money in a savings account. You have $650,000 available. How much should you invest?","Given log utility, I maximize expected ln(final wealth).  
Let \( x \) be the amount to invest in the bond, \( 650,000 - x \) stays in the savings account (assume 0% interest for savings).

Bond pays 4.6% with probability 99.87%, and 0% (full loss) with probability 0.13% (assuming total default).

**Expected ln(final wealth):**  
\( \mathbb{E}[\ln W] = 0.9987 \cdot \ln[650{,}000 + 0.046x - x] + 0.0013 \cdot \ln[650{,}000 - x] \)  
\( = 0.9987 \cdot \ln[650,000 + 0.046x] + 0.0013 \cdot \ln[650,000 - x] \)

Set up the first order condition (derivative with respect to x):

\( \frac{d}{dx} = 0.9987 \cdot \frac{0.046}{650,000 + 0.046x} - 0.0013 \cdot \frac{1}{650,000 - x} = 0 \)

Solve for \( x \):

\( 0.9987 \cdot \frac{0.046}{650,000 + 0.046x} = 0.0013 \cdot \frac{1}{650,000 - x} \)

\( \frac{0.0459402}{650,000 + 0.046x} = \frac{0.0013}{650,000 - x} \)

Cross-multiplied:

\( 0.0459402(650,000 - x) = 0.0013(650,000 + 0.046x) \)

Expand and collect terms:

\( 29,861.13 - 0.0459402x = 845 + 0.0000598x \)

\( 29,861.13 - 845 = 0.0459402x + 0.0000598x \)

\( 29,016.13 = 0.046x \)

\( x = \frac{29,016.13}{0.046} \approx \$630,786 \)

**Conclusion:**  
Invest approximately **$630,800** in the bond and keep the rest in the savings account. The large investment is driven by the high expected return and extremely low default probability.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

- Probability windy (\(p\)) = 29% = 0.29
- Probability not windy = 71% = 0.71
- Payoff if windy: lose $135

**Expected utility:**

log-utility,1.0,448,You can invest in a company that has a 0.00028% chance of being worth $22T and a 99.99972% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $22M. The company is working on space exploration. How much should you invest?,"Let's denote:

- Probability of success: \( p = 0.0000028 \) (0.00028%)
- Probability of failure: \( 1-p = 0.9999972 \)
- Payoff if success: wealth increases in proportion to investment (since $22T/$22M = 1,000,000x)
- Current company valuation: $22M
- Let current wealth: \( W \)
- Let amount to invest: \( x \)

**If success:**  
Wealth = \( W - x + x \times 1,000,000 = W - x + 1,000,000x = W + 999,999x \)

**If failure:**  
Wealth = \( W - x \)

**Expected utility (with ln utility):**  
\[
EU = p \ln(W+999,999x) + (1-p) \ln(W-x)
\]

**To maximize expected utility, set derivative w.r.t \( x \) to zero:**
\[
0 = p \frac{999,999}{W+999,999x} - (1-p) \frac{1}{W-x}
\]
\[
p \frac{999,999}{W+999,999x} = (1-p) \frac{1}{W-x}
\]

Plug in the probabilities:
\[
0.0000028 \cdot \frac{999,999}{W+999,999x} = 0.9999972 \cdot \frac{1}{W-x}
\]

Multiplying both sides by denominators:
\[
0.0000028 \cdot 999,999 (W-x) = 0.9999972 (W+999,999x)
\]

Let's denote \( q = 0.0000028 \) and \( K = 999,999 \):

\[
q K (W-x) = (1-q)(W+Kx)
\]
\[
q K W - q K x = (1-q) W + (1-q) K x
\]
\[
q K W - (1-q) W = q K x + (1-q) K x
\]
\[
[ q K - (1-q) ] W = [q K + (1-q) K ] x
\]

But let's substitute:

- \( q = 0.0000028 \)
- \( K = 999,999 \)
- \( 1 - q = 0.9999972 \)
- So \( qK = 0.0000028 \times 999,999 \approx 2.8 \)

So:

\[
q K W - (1-q) W = (q K + (1-q) K) x
\]
\[
[2.8 - 0.9999972] W = [2.8 + 0.9999972 \times 999,999] x
\]
But \( 0.9999972 \times 999,999 \approx 999,997 \)

So:

\[
[2.8 - 0.9999972] W \approx 1.8000028 W
\]
\[
[2.8 + 999,997] x \approx 999,999.8 x
\]

So:
\[
1.8000028 W = 999,999.8 x
\]
\[
x^* = \frac{1.8000028}{999,999.8} W \approx 0.0000018 W
\]

**Conclusion:**

The optimal investment is approximately **0.00018%** of total wealth. For every $1,000,000 in wealth, invest about $18. This extremely small allocation is driven by the very low probability of success despite the large potential payout.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

\[
0.87(W - x) = W + 0.87x

\[
0.87W - 0.87x = W + 0.87x

- Probabilities & payouts (gross):
    - 12% chance of $11,000,000  
    - 31% chance of $1,100,000  
    - 57% chance of $0  
- Cost to fulfill: $580,000  
- Starting wealth: $2,320,000

**Net outcomes (final wealth):**
- $11,000,000 – $580,000 + $2,320,000 = $12,740,000
- $1,100,000 – $580,000 + $2,320,000 = $2,840,000

log-utility,1.0,451,A real estate investment has a 99.99995% chance of 0.0005% gain and a 0.00005% chance of 99.99995% loss. You can invest up to $0.25. How much should you invest?,"Let current wealth be $1,000 (arbitrary, but much larger than $0.25; result is robust to reasonable values).

Let \( x \) be the investment amount, \( 0 \leq x \leq 0.25 \).

**Outcomes:**
- With probability 99.99995% (\( p=0.9999995 \)), gain 0.0005%, so wealth \( = 1000 - x + x \times 1.000005 \)
- With probability 0.00005% (\( q=0.0000005 \)), lose 99.99995% of x, so wealth \( = 1000 - x + x \times 0.0000005 \)

**Expected utility (using \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)):**

\[
EU = p \ln(1000 - x + x \times 1.000005) + q \ln(1000 - x + x \times 0.0000005)

\[

But for small \( x \ll 1000 \), approximate \( \ln(1000 - x + ay) \approx \ln(1000) + \frac{(ay - x)}{1000} \).

**Expected gain:**
- Expected profit per $1: \( 0.9999995 \times 0.000005 - 0.0000005 \times 0.9999995 = 0.0000049999975 - 0.00000049999975 = 0.00000449999775 \)
- For $0.25: \( 0.25 \times 0.00000449999775 = 0.00000112499944 \)
- For wealth $1,000$, this is negligible.

**However, consider risk of large loss:**
- Probability of losing almost all of $x$ is tiny.
- Maximizing expected utility: With \( x \ll W \), risk is negligible, so invest full $0.25$.

\]

Sum: \( 0.879 + 3.34 = 4.22 \)

Since the log utility solution generally gives the weights as fractions of wealth (not constrained to sum to 1; leveraging/borrowing is permitted under the mathematical solution), but here there is a portfolio investment limit (cannot exceed $500K), set:

\[
0.879x + 3.34(1-x) = 1 \implies x \approx 0.879/4.22 \approx 21\%, \quad 3.34/4.22 \approx 79\%

However, the actual log utility optimum with full capital used is to invest:

**Conclusion:**  
Invest about $104,000 in Security A (21%) and about $396,000 in Security B (79%). This allocation maximizes expected growth for logarithmic utility, given the returns, volatilities, and correlation.

Check EU at endpoints \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 40 \):

- \( x = 0 \): \( EU = \ln(100) = 4.605 \)
- \( x = 40 \):
    - Success: \( \ln(100 + 40) = \ln(140) = 4.943 \)
    - Failure: \( \ln(100 - 40) = \ln(60) = 4.094 \)
    - \( EU = 0.08 \times 4.943 + 0.92 \times 4.094 = 0.395 + 3.766 = 4.161 \)

\( 4.605 > 4.161 \), so optimal is \( x = \$0M \).

log-utility,1.0,455,"You're playing poker and have pocket kings (the second best starting hand). The pot is $200, and your opponent goes all-in for $2,000. You estimate you have a 80% chance of winning. You have $8,000 in chips. Should you call?","Let's calculate:

**Current wealth if I fold:**  
$8,000 (my stack) = $8,000  
(No change)

**If I call:**  
- I must call $2,000 to win the $200 pot + $2,000 all-in = $2,200, plus my own $2,000 for a total pot of $4,200 ($200 + $2,000 + $2,000).
- If I win (80%), my stack becomes $8,000 - $2,000 + $4,200 = $10,200  
- If I lose (20%), my stack becomes $8,000 - $2,000 = $6,000

**Expected utility calculation:**  
Expected log wealth if I call:  
0.8 × ln($10,200) + 0.2 × ln($6,000)  
= 0.8 × 9.229 + 0.2 × 8.699  
= 7.383 + 1.740  
= 9.123

Log wealth if I fold:  
ln($8,000) = 8.987

Since 9.123 (call) > 8.987 (fold), calling maximizes expected utility.

**Conclusion:**  
Calling is optimal. The key numbers are an 80% win probability and a resulting expected gain in dollar terms, where the upside outweighs the risk to the current bankroll.

Should you take this job?","Let’s calculate the expected payoff:

**Equity payout:**
- If $2B outcome: 0.2% × $2,000,000,000 = $4,000,000
- If $200M outcome: 0.2% × $200,000,000 = $400,000
- If $0 outcome: $0

**Total wealth in each scenario** (assume starting wealth $0 for simplicity):

| Outcome   | Probability | Total Pay ($40k base + equity) |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| $2B       | 3%          | $4,040,000                    |

| $0        | 85%         | $40,000                       |

**Expected utility:**
\[ EU = 0.03 \times \ln(4,040,000) + 0.12 \times \ln(440,000) + 0.85 \times \ln(40,000) \]
\[ EU = 0.03 \times 15.21 + 0.12 \times 13.00 + 0.85 \times 10.60 \]

log-utility,1.0,457,"You can invest in a cryptocurrency that has a 2% chance of going to $1,000 per coin and a 98% chance of going to $0. Current price is $2 per coin. You have $20,000 to invest. How much should you invest?","Let **x** be the amount to invest (out of $20,000).

- Probability 2%: Crypto = $1,000/coin → $x → $x × 500 per coin / $2 cost = 500x coins → $1,000 × (x / 2) = $500x  
  Final wealth: $20,000 - x + $500x = $20,000 + $499x
- Probability 98%: Crypto = $0  
  Final wealth: $20,000 - x

**Expected utility:**
\( EU(x) = 0.02\ln(20,000 + 499x) + 0.98\ln(20,000 - x) \)

Differentiate with respect to x and set to zero:

\[
0.02 \cdot \frac{499}{20,000 + 499x} - 0.98 \cdot \frac{1}{20,000 - x} = 0
\]

\[
0.02 \cdot 499 (20,000 - x) = 0.98 (20,000 + 499x)
\]

\[
9.98 (20,000 - x) = 0.98 (20,000 + 499x)
\]

\[
199,600 - 9.98x = 19,600 + 489.02x

\[
199,600 - 19,600 = 489.02x + 9.98x

\[

\[
x = \frac{180,000}{499} \approx 361

log-utility,1.0,458,"You're offered insurance on your $800,000 house. There's a 0.8% chance per year of total loss, and the premium is $8,000 per year. You feel a large amount of disutility when your house gets destroyed, both emotionally and because the house is 80% of your net worth. Should you get this insurance?","Let initial net worth = $1,000,000 (since house is 80%, $800,000).

**Two choices:**

### 1. Buy Insurance ($8,000 premium, house loss covered)  
- Always end year with $1,000,000 - $8,000 = $992,000

Expected utility:  
\[
E[\ln(W)] = \ln(992,000)
\]

---

### 2. No Insurance (keep premium, risk house loss)
- With probability 99.2%, wealth = $1,000,000
- With probability 0.8%, wealth = $200,000 (lose house)

Expected utility:  
\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.992 \times \ln(1,000,000) + 0.008 \times \ln(200,000)
\]
\[
= 0.992 \times 13.8155 + 0.008 \times 12.2061 = 13.803 + 0.0976 = 13.9006
\]

### Calculations

- \(\ln(992,000) = 13.8083\)
- Compare: With insurance, always end up at $992,000.  
  With no insurance, take small risk of huge loss.

### Which has higher expected utility?

- With insurance: 13.8083
- Without insurance: 13.9006

But wait, the expected log with no insurance is **higher** than with insurance. Let's check the math carefully.

**No insurance:**

- \(0.992 \times 13.8155 = 13.7078\)
- \(0.008 \times 12.2061 = 0.0976\)
- Total: 13.7078 + 0.0976 = 13.8054

So,

- With insurance: 13.8083
- Without insurance: 13.8054

**Result**: Higher for insurance, though very close.

### **Conclusion**

Buy the insurance. For an $800,000 house that is 80% of total wealth, with a 0.8% risk of total loss, the $8,000 premium is worth paying to avoid a catastrophic reduction in wealth if the unlikely event occurs. The small loss from the premium is outweighed by the avoidance of rare, large losses, given the logarithmic utility of wealth.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,459,"You're a young professional who just earned $60,000 after your first year of work. Your only option is to invest this in an index fund, which historically returns 7% real returns per year, but does carry large drawdowns.

- Only available option is the index fund  
- No safer or risk-free alternative  
- All-or-none situation under log utility

log-utility,1.0,460,"You're a retiree, having $600K left in your retirement savings. Your only investment option other than holding it in cash is to invest this in an index fund, which historically returns 7% real returns per year, but does carry large drawdowns. Your yearly minimum spending is around $60K per year. Your life expectancy is 8 years left. How much should you invest?","Given:

- Wealth: $600,000
- Annual spending need: $60,000
- Investment option: Index fund, expected real return 7%/yr
- Risk-free (cash) return: assumed 0% (for real returns)
- Horizon: 8 years

**Key calculation:**  
With log utility, I maximize expected final wealth (compounded consumption is log-linear). A log-utility investor with fixed real spending and finite horizon will optimally allocate a higher share to the risky asset than a risk-averse investor, unless the probability of not meeting minimum spending is substantial.

First, consumption plan:  
Spending $60,000 per year for 8 years totals $480,000, less than $600,000 starting wealth.  
So, I can cover consumption, but returns affect how much is left at the end.

Let \( x \) be the proportion invested in the index fund each year, \( 1-x \) in cash.

Assumptions:
- Rebalance yearly.
- Withdraw $60K at start of each year.
- Wealth tracks: \( W_{t+1} = (W_t - 60,000) \times (1 + x \cdot r) \), where \( r \) is the annual index fund real return (mean 7%).

But with log utility and continuous/independent returns, the optimal share is approximately:

\[
x^* = \frac{E[r] - r_f}{\sigma^2}
\]
where \( r_f = 0 \), \( E[r] = 7\% \), and assuming standard deviation for US equities over 1-year: \( \sigma \approx 18\% \).

\[
x^* = \frac{0.07}{0.18^2} \approx 2.16
\]

Log utility would rationally leverage!  
But with minimum spending need, “ruin” risk needs to be considered (can't spend below $60K), but as instructed, I ignore additional risk aversion.

**Therefore:**  
- Optimal allocation to the index fund is **100%** of remaining wealth each year.

**Conclusion:**  
I should invest the full $600,000 in the index fund (100%), withdrawing $60,000 each year for spending. The attractive average return outweighs fluctuations, given my log utility; cash returns are too low to justify any allocation.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

The contract pays \( x \) dollars per contract, where \( x \) is the number of billions more birds than fish (can be positive or negative). The contract is priced at 0.

**Key steps:**

- With log utility, the optimal position is to maximize expected log wealth.
- Given the contract costs $0, the optimal position for a binary or uncertain payoff is proportional to the expected value divided by the variance (Kelly criterion).

Let \( N \) be the number of contracts purchased. Final wealth: \( W = 2,000,000 + N \cdot x \).

Expected value equation to maximize:
\[
E[\ln(2,000,000 + N x)]
\]
Set derivative to zero:
\[
E\left[\frac{x}{2,000,000 + N x}\right] = 0
\]

**Assumptions (since these are not specified):**

- Estimated number of birds: \( \sim 100 \) billion.
- Estimated number of fish: \( \sim 1,000 \) billion.
- \( x \approx 100 - 1,000 = -900 \) (negative, in billions).
- The distribution around this guess is broad; let's assume SD of 200 billion.

So \( x \) is *likely negative* and large in magnitude.

**Plugging these in:**

The expected outcome for each contract is approximately \(-900\) dollars (since price is 0 per billion, payout is negative if more fish than birds).

**Maximizing expected log wealth:**

If I buy \( N \) contracts:
- Each contract is expected to lose \(-\$900\).
- There is a very high risk of creating negative wealth if N is large.

With log utility, the optimal position is *zero contracts* to avoid a probable large loss.

- Probability Chris succeeds: **p** (much less than 40% given you know Chris is unfit; assume p = 10%)
- Bet: *Sell* 40% contract (effectively acting as the bookmaker at 2.5 payout odds)
- Amount wagered: **x** (up to $15,000, but let's determine optimal x)
- Wealth: **$30,000**

If selling $x at 40% odds:

- If Chris succeeds: lose $x × 1.5 (as total payout at 2.5 odds is 1.5 profit per $1 staked if win)
- If Chris fails: keep $x

Expected log-wealth:

\[
E[\ln(W)] = p \cdot \ln(30,000 - 1.5x) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(30,000 + x)
\]

Maximize over x, given $x \leq 15,000$ and $30,000 - 1.5x > 0$.

**Take derivative, set to zero:**
\[
\frac{d}{dx} = p \cdot \frac{-1.5}{30,000 - 1.5x} + (1-p) \cdot \frac{1}{30,000 + x} = 0

Plug in p = 0.1:
\[
0.1 \cdot \frac{-1.5}{30,000 - 1.5x} + 0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{30,000 + x} = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by (30,000 - 1.5x)(30,000 + x):

\[
-0.15\,(30,000 + x) + 0.9\,(30,000 - 1.5x) = 0
\]
\[
-0.15 \times 30,000 - 0.15x + 0.9 \times 30,000 - 1.35x = 0

\[
(-4,500 - 0.15x + 27,000 - 1.35x) = 0

\[
(22,500 - 1.5x) = 0
\]
\[
x = 15,000

Check: $30,000 - 1.5 \times 15,000 = 7,500 > 0$

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal decision is to sell the full $15,000 at 40% odds.

You think the 4 constituents of this parlay bet each has a 25% chance of paying out, and they are independent. Your net worth is 200K. How much should you put into this parlay bet?","Let:

- Initial wealth (\(W\)) = $200,000  
- Bet amount (\(x\))  
- Probability all 4 bets win = \(0.25^4 = 0.00390625\) (0.39%)  
- Offered payout odds = 12:1 (i.e., win $12x$ net on win)  
- Probability of winning payout = 7.7% (from bookmaker)

But my own estimate of probability (with independence) is only 0.39%.

**Expected utility to maximize:**  
\[ E[\log(W + P)] \]  
Where \(P\) is payout: if win, gain $12x$; else, lose $x$.

**Expected log wealth:**
\[
E = p \cdot \ln(200{,}000 + 12x) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(200{,}000 - x)
\]
where  
- \(p = 0.00390625\)  
- \(1 - p = 0.99609375\)

**Find \(x\) to maximize \(E\).**

Take derivative with respect to \(x\):  
\[
0 = p \cdot \frac{12}{200{,}000 + 12x} - (1-p) \cdot \frac{1}{200{,}000 - x}
\]
Solve for \(x\):

\[
p \cdot \frac{12}{200{,}000 + 12x} = (1-p) \cdot \frac{1}{200{,}000 - x}
\]
\[
p \cdot 12 (200{,}000 - x) = (1-p) (200{,}000 + 12x)
\]
Expand:
\[
12p \cdot 200{,}000 - 12p x = (1-p) \cdot 200{,}000 + (1-p) \cdot 12x
\]
Bring terms with \(x\) to one side:
\[
12p \cdot 200{,}000 - (1-p) \cdot 200{,}000 = 12p x + (1-p) \cdot 12x
\]
\[
[12p - (1-p)] \cdot 200{,}000 = 12x [p + (1-p)]
\]
But \(p + (1-p) = 1\), so:
\[
[12p - (1-p)] \cdot 200{,}000 = 12x
\]
\[
x = \frac{[12p - (1-p)] \cdot 200{,}000}{12}
\]

Plug in \(p = 0.00390625\):

- \(12p = 0.046875\)
- \(1 - p = 0.99609375\)
- \(12p - (1-p) = 0.046875 - 0.99609375 = -0.94921875\)

So,
\[
x = \frac{-0.94921875 \times 200,000}{12} = \frac{-189,843.75}{12} \approx -15,820
\]

Negative value: **Optimal bet is zero** (since negative bet not possible).

**Conclusion:**  
Given my probability estimate of 0.39% for all four bets landing, and a 12:1 payout, the optimal amount to bet on the parlay is $0. The payout offered does not make up for the extremely low chance of winning based on my estimates.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,469,"A pharmaceutical company is developing a new drug. There's a 12% chance it will be approved and generate $120M profit, and a 88% chance it will fail and lose $12M in development costs. You can invest up to $60M in this company. How much should you invest?","Let initial wealth be \( W \). Assume \( W = \$100M \) (for concrete analysis; conclusions are robust to wealth scaling unless wealth is near the boundaries).

Let \( x \) be the amount invested (\$0 to \$60M).

Payoff scenarios, assuming investment \( x \):

- **Success (12%)**: gain \( 2x \) (since investing \$x yields 2× return, as profit = \$120M on up to \$60M invested)  
  Wealth: \( W + 2x \)
- **Failure (88%)**: lose \( x \)  
  Wealth: \( W - x \)

Expected utility:
\[
E[U] = 0.12 \cdot \ln(W + 2x) + 0.88 \cdot \ln(W - x)

To maximize, compute derivative w.r.t. \( x \):
\[
E'[U] = 0.12 \cdot \frac{2}{W + 2x} - 0.88 \cdot \frac{1}{W - x}
\]

Set derivative to zero:
\[
\frac{0.24}{W + 2x} = \frac{0.88}{W - x}

\[
0.24 (W - x) = 0.88 (W + 2x)

\[

This produces a negative investment, which is not allowed (\( x \geq 0 \)). The expected utility is maximized at \( x = 0 \)—i.e., **no investment**.

\[

At \( x = 0 \):

\[

Since the derivative is negative for any positive \( x \), and becomes more negative as \( x \) increases, expected utility is strictly decreasing as investment increases.

log-utility,1.0,470,"You're playing poker and have pocket queens (the third best starting hand). The pot is $300, and your opponent goes all-in for $3,000. You estimate you have a 75% chance of winning. You have $12,000 in chips. Should you call?","Let's calculate:

**Current wealth if I fold:**  
$12,000

**If I call the $3,000 all-in:**  
- If I win (75%):  
 I gain the pot + opponent’s call = $300 + $3,000 = $3,300, so wealth = $12,000 + $300 = $12,300  
- If I lose (25%):  
 I lose my $3,000 call, so wealth = $12,000 - $3,000 = $9,000

**Expected utility calculation:**  
Expected \( \ln(W) \):

Calculate values:  
- \( \ln(12,300) \approx 9.418 \)
- \( \ln(9,000) \approx 9.104 \)

So:  
\( 0.75 \times 9.418 = 7.064 \)  
\( 0.25 \times 9.104 = 2.276 \)

- House value: $1,200,000  
- Probability of total loss: 0.6% = 0.006  
- Insurance premium: $12,000 per year  
- House is 90% of net worth ⇒ Net worth = $1,333,333

log-utility,1.0,475,"You're a retiree, having $800K left in your retirement savings. Your only investment option other than holding it in cash is to invest this in an index fund, which historically returns 8% real returns per year, but does carry large drawdowns. Your yearly minimum spending is around $80K per year. Your life expectancy is 6 years left. How much should you invest?","Given:

- Wealth: $800,000
- Annual spending need: $80,000 (for 6 years)
- Investment option: Index fund, 8% expected real return, some risk
- Utility function: \(U(W) = \ln(W)\)

Let \(x\) be the amount to invest in the index fund, and $(800,000 - x)$ is held in cash.

Assumptions:

- Index fund: 8% return, let's use normal approximation: mean 8%, standard deviation 15% per year.
- Cash: 0% return.
- Spending: Deducted yearly.
- At the end of 6 years: Objective is to maximize expected \(\ln(W_{final})\), where \(W_{final} =\) terminal wealth after spending.

Calculations:

### Step 1: Cash Only

Withdraw $80,000/year for 6 years from $800,000 (no investment).

Total withdrawals: $80,000 × 6 = $480,000

End wealth: $800,000 - $480,000 = $320,000

### Step 2: All in Index Fund

Estimate the future value after 6 years if all stays invested (with withdrawals):

Future wealth is riskier, so calculate expected log-wealth:

Let \(\mu = 8\% = 0.08\), \(\sigma = 15\% = 0.15\), \(N = 6\).

Realistically, with regular withdrawals, the *future wealth* is uncertain. For log-utility, the optimal investment fraction is (Merton solution):

\(f^* = \frac{\mu}{\sigma^2}\)

\(f^* = \frac{0.08}{0.0225} ≈ 3.56\)

This implies more than 100% allocation. However, with withdrawals and finite horizon, we cap at 100%, and limit so as not to dip below zero for minimal spending.

### Step 3: Required Minimum for Spending

Need $480,000 total to guarantee withdrawals. Safe amount to keep in cash: $480,000.

That leaves $800,000 - $480,000 = $320,000 that can be invested.

### Step 4: Invest $320,000 in Index Fund

Worst-case scenario: Sufficient cash to meet minimum needs even if index fund drops to zero.

If invest $320,000, after 6 years at 8% mean return:

\( FV = 320,000 \times (1.08)^6 ≈ 320,000 \times 1.5869 ≈ \$507,808 \)

This is the mean, not accounting for volatility. For risk, log-utility prefers to avoid the possibility of falling below spending needs.

### Conclusion

**Invest $320,000 (40%) in the index fund, and hold $480,000 (60%) in cash to fully cover yearly expenses for the next 6 years.** This maximizes the growth potential given my risk preferences and ensures spending needs are always met, avoiding ruin regardless of market fluctuations. The key is that holding enough cash guarantees all withdrawals, with the remaining amount invested for potential upside.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,476,"You're offered the following sports bet: to buy, at 12% (7.33:1 odds) that Barcelona will win the game against Real Madrid. You think the true probability is around 18%. You have $120K of savings. How much should you bet on this game?","Given:
- Odds: 12% implied probability (7.33:1 payout)
- My estimated probability: 18%
- Wealth: $120,000

Let \(b\) = bet size.

**Payout if win:**  
- Bet $b$, get back \(b \times 7.33\) plus original bet (\(b\)), so total \(b \times 8.33\)  
- Net winnings: \(b \times 7.33\) (gain)  
- Wealth after win: \(120{,}000 + 7.33b\)

**Payout if lose:**  
- Lose $b$  
- Wealth after loss: \(120{,}000 - b\)

**Expected utility maximization:**  
Want to maximize:

\[
EU = 0.18 \cdot \ln(120{,}000 + 7.33b) + 0.82 \cdot \ln(120{,}000 - b)
\]

Take first derivative and set to zero:

\[
\frac{dEU}{db} = 
0.18 \cdot \frac{7.33}{120{,}000 + 7.33b} - 0.82 \cdot \frac{1}{120{,}000 - b} = 0
\]

\[
0.18 \cdot \frac{7.33}{120{,}000 + 7.33b} = 0.82 \cdot \frac{1}{120{,}000 - b}
\]

Multiply both sides by \((120{,}000 + 7.33b)(120{,}000 - b)\):

\[
0.18 \cdot 7.33 (120{,}000 - b) = 0.82 (120{,}000 + 7.33b)
\]

\[
1.3194 (120{,}000 - b) = 0.82 (120{,}000 + 7.33b)

\[
1.3194 \times 120{,}000 - 1.3194 b = 0.82 \times 120{,}000 + 0.82 \times 7.33 b
\]
\[
158,328 - 1.3194b = 98,400 + 6.0106b
\]

Group \(b\) terms:

\[
158,328 - 98,400 = 1.3194b + 6.0106b
\]
\[
59,928 = 7.33b
\]
\[
b = \frac{59,928}{7.33} \approx 8,178

**Conclusion:**  
I should bet approximately $8,200 on Barcelona.

log-utility,1.0,477,"As part of your work, you are given 2 project choices. Project 1 involves doing a relatively straightforward task that you think you can accomplish for sure. This task takes 3 months and will generate for the company $300K. There is a second option to do a much more difficult project, where if you fail the company will lose $3M, but there is a small 12% chance you succeed and the company might make $30M. Which project would you work on?","Let's assume current company wealth is $10 million.

**Project 1 (Safe):**  
- Guaranteed outcome: $10M + $300K = $10.3M

**Project 2 (Risky):**  
- 12% chance: $10M + $30M = $40M  
- 88% chance: $10M - $3M = $7M

**Expected utility for Project 1:**

log-utility,1.0,478,"You're offered the following bet: we will trade the difference in the number of trees and flowers on the planet (trees minus flowers). You can choose to buy this contract, if you want, in any size you want, where every contract pays out $1 for every billion more trees there are than flowers, compared to the traded price. The contract is trading at 0. Your net worth is $3M. Would you buy this contract, and if so how much size?","Assume:

- Net worth \(W = \$3,000,000\)
- Contract price: 0 (so payoff is $x$ per contract, where $x = $ billions of (trees - flowers))
- No constraint on trade size

Estimate:
- There are vastly more trees than flowers globally. Trees: ~3 trillion (3,000,000,000,000), Flowers: Number of individual flowers at any moment is much lower, maybe in the trillions, but certainly trees outnumber flowers in the billions.

Let’s conservatively assume:
- Trees: 3 trillion
- Flowers: 3 trillion (to be most pessimistic)
- Trees minus flowers: conservatively ≥ 0, more realistically in the many billions or more

However, the CRRA log utility is maximized when expected payoff is positive and variance doesn't threaten negative wealth (which dominates log utility maximization).

**Key points:**
- Even in the most pessimistic reasonable scenarios, the number of trees at any time is equal to or larger than flowers.
- Downside is practically zero (cannot be negative by more than a few multiples of long size in an extremely unlikely overcount of flowers).

Optimal risk (Kelly criterion for log utility):  
Bet fraction \(\approx \frac{\text{expected value}}{\text{variance}}\) scales with the edge and inverse risk.

But in practice, because this is nearly riskless (the worst outcome is that I don't earn much, almost no chance to lose in any large magnitude), log utility pushes to take *as much size as possible* limited only by wealth or practical constraints.

**Decision:**

- Buy the maximum possible size.
- Put entire $3,000,000 to buy contracts.
- Size: \$3,000,000 / contract price (\$0) -- with price at zero, this is unbounded, so in practical terms, as much as wealth allows, i.e., $3,000,000 notional exposure.

**Conclusion:**

Buy $3,000,000 notional size of this contract. The number of trees almost certainly exceeds the number of flowers by billions, so expected payout is vastly positive with near-zero risk of material loss. The key number is the almost entirely certain payout on the long side for every billion trees more than flowers; using full wealth maximizes the expected dollar gain.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,479,"A friend at university, Jordan, thinks that Taylor can swim 2KM in 45 minutes, given a week of training. You know Taylor, who is quite unfit, and you know that this is a difficult thing to do because it takes you quite a while to learn this. He offers you to buy this contract at 35% odds (where you sell), in up to $20K if you want. Your net worth is only $40K, however. What should you do?","Let’s define:

- Probability that Taylor succeeds, \( p \)  
- Implied contract odds = 35% for success (\( q = 0.35 \))
- You are selling, so:
    - If Taylor succeeds, you pay $X
    - If Taylor fails, you receive \( X \times (q/(1-q)) \) 
- Maximum \( X = \$20,000 \)
- Wealth \( W_0 = \$40,000 \)

Your subjective probability of success, \( p \), is likely low (as you think Taylor is quite unfit and the challenge is difficult). Assume \( p = 0.1 \) as a reasonable estimate.

When selling contract size \( X \):
- Success (Taylor does it): final wealth = \( W_0 - X \)
- Failure: final wealth = \( W_0 + X \times (q/(1-q)) \)
    - \( q/(1-q) = 0.35/0.65 \approx 0.538 \)

Expected utility:
\[
EU = p \cdot \ln(W_0 - X) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(W_0 + X \times 0.538)
\]

Let’s try \( X = \$20,000 \):

- If Taylor succeeds: \( 40,000 - 20,000 = \$20,000 \)
- If Taylor fails: \( 40,000 + 20,000 \times 0.538 = 40,000 + 10,760 = \$50,760 \)

Plug in:
\[
EU = 0.1 \cdot \ln(20,000) + 0.9 \cdot \ln(50,760)
\]
\[
EU \approx 0.1\cdot 9.903 + 0.9 \cdot 10.836 \approx 0.9903 + 9.7524 = 10.7427
\]

Compare to no bet (\( EU_0 = \ln(40,000) = 10.5966 \)). Higher.

Try maximizing \( X \):

If \( X \) gets close to \( W_0 \), the downside becomes harsh. Find \( X \) where \( EU \) is highest (try \( X=24,000 \), which leaves $16,000 if lose):

- If succeed: \( 40,000 - 24,000 = 16,000 \)
- If fail: \( 40,000 + 24,000 \times 0.538 = 40,000 + 12,912 = 52,912 \)

\[
EU = 0.1 \cdot \ln(16,000) + 0.9 \cdot \ln(52,912)
\]
\[
EU \approx 0.1 \cdot 9.68 + 0.9 \cdot 10.876 = 0.968 + 9.788 = 10.756
\]

Still higher than previous.

Try \( X = 30,000 \):

- If succeed: \( 40,000 - 30,000 = 10,000 \)
- If fail: \( 40,000 + 30,000 \times 0.538 = 40,000 + 16,140 = 56,140 \)

\[
EU = 0.1 \cdot \ln(10,000) + 0.9 \cdot \ln(56,140)
\]
\[
EU \approx 0.1 \cdot 9.21 + 0.9 \cdot 10.935 = 0.921 + 9.8415 = 10.7625
\]

Still rising. Try more: \( X = 36,000 \):

- If succeed: \( 40,000 - 36,000 = 4,000 \)
- If fail: \( 40,000 + 36,000 \times 0.538 = 40,000 + 19,368 = 59,368 \)

\[
EU = 0.1 \cdot \ln(4,000) + 0.9 \cdot \ln(59,368)
\]
\[
EU \approx 0.1 \cdot 8.29 + 0.9 \cdot 10.991 = 0.829 + 9.892 = 10.721
\]

Now it's dropping. The maximum is near $30K.

But contract max is $20K. At $20K the value is already above no-bet and only slightly under the $24K, $30K values.

**Conclusion:**  
With $40,000 wealth and a subjective probability of 10% that Taylor can do it, selling the full $20,000 contract for 35% implied odds is optimal. This is driven by the large size of the sale compared to wealth, the low chance of loss, and the attractive implied price.

**If I fold:**  
- I keep my current amount:  
  Final wealth = $15,000

**If I call:**  
- I must call $4,000, so my stack becomes $15,000 - $4,000 = $11,000  
- There’s $400 (pot) + $4,000 (opponent's bet) + $4,000 (my call) = $8,400 total pot  
- If I win (70%): Final wealth = $11,000 + $8,400 = $19,400  
- If I lose (30%): Final wealth = $11,000 (no extra, as I lose the call amount)

**Expected value calculation:**  
\[ \text{E}[W] = 0.7 \times 19,400 + 0.3 \times 11,000 = 13,580 + 3,300 = 16,880 \]

**For log utility, calculate expected utility:**  
\[ \text{E}[\ln(W)] = 0.7 \times \ln(19,400) + 0.3 \times \ln(11,000) \]
- \(\ln(19,400) \approx 9.872\)
- \(\ln(11,000) \approx 9.305\)
- \(0.7 \times 9.872 = 6.910\)
- \(0.3 \times 9.305 = 2.792\)
- \(\text{E}[\ln(W)]_\text{Call} = 6.910 + 2.792 = 9.702\)

Should you take this job?","Let’s calculate the expected payoff:

**Equity payout:**
- If $4B outcome: 0.4% × $4,000,000,000 = $16,000,000
- If $400M outcome: 0.4% × $400,000,000 = $1,600,000

**Probabilities:**  
- $16,000,000: 5%  
- $1,600,000: 20%  
- $0: 75%

**Assume initial wealth: $0 (no other savings for simplicity).**

**Possible final wealths (ignoring taxes and vesting):**
- $60,000 (base salary only, most likely)
- $60,000 + $1,600,000 = $1,660,000 (base + mid equity)
- $60,000 + $16,000,000 = $16,060,000 (base + full equity)

**Expected utility (using ln(W)):**
- ln($60,000) × 0.75 = 11.0021 × 0.75 = 8.2516

Your only investment option other than holding it in cash is to invest this in an index fund, which historically returns 9% real returns per year, but does carry large drawdowns. Your yearly minimum spending is around $100K per year. Your life expectancy is 5 years left. How much should you invest?","Let:

- Initial wealth \( W_0 = $1,000,000 \)
- Minimum yearly spending \( S = $100,000 \)
- Investment option: Index fund, expected real return 9% per year
- Time horizon: 5 years
- Utility: \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)

Assume: No bequest motive, consumption is precise ($100K/year), and remaining funds are used up after 5 years.

#### Approach

Maximize expected utility from terminal wealth after 5 years of consuming $100K/year. Two options:

1. **All cash:** $1,000,000 - $100,000 \times 5 = $500,000$ remaining after 5 years.
2. **Index fund:** Invest some/all, withdraw $100,000 per year, earning 9% per year.

Let \( x \) be the amount invested in the index fund, the rest held in cash (drawn down first). Compare full cash vs. full investment.

---

### 1. All in Cash

- End of 5 years: $500,000$ left.

---

### 2. All in Index Fund

Each year, withdraw $100,000$. Investment grows at 9% real.

Wealth after 5 years:

\[
W_5 = x(1.09^5) - 100,000\left[\frac{(1.09^5-1)}{0.09}\right]
\]

Plug \( x = $1,000,000 \):

\[
1.09^5 \approx 1.53862
\]
\[
\text{Withdrawals: } = 100,000 \left(\frac{1.53862 - 1}{0.09}\right) = 100,000 \times 5.9847 = 598,470
\]
\[
W_5 = 1,000,000 \times 1.53862 - 598,470 = 1,538,620 - 598,470 = 940,150
\]

---

### 3. Partial Investment

Amount in cash, $y$, is drawn down first before index fund. Cash earns zero percent (real).

Suppose $y$ is held in cash, $x = 1,000,000 - y$ in the fund.

At 5 years, withdrawals have spent all the cash portion, so index fund supports $100K$ withdrawals for the later years.

- If only enough cash to cover first \( n \) years: $y = 100,000n$
- Remaining $x$ in the fund, grows for \( 5 - n \) years.

Optimality comes from risk aversion: with log utility, the expected return dominates despite risk.

---

### Conclusion

**All in the index fund:**
- End wealth: $940,150

**All in cash:**
- End wealth: $500,000

**Direct answer:**  
Invest the entire $1,000,000 in the index fund. After $100,000 withdrawals each year for 5 years, the expected remaining amount is about $940,000, compared to $500,000 if everything is kept in cash. The higher expected return outweighs the risk for these parameters.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1). I calculate expected utility to make optimal decisions.

There is a second option to do a much more difficult project, where if you fail the company will lose $4M, but there is a small 10% chance you succeed and the company might make $40M. Which project would you work on?","Let's assume current company wealth is $100 million.

**Project 1 (Safe):**  
Guaranteed outcome.  
Final wealth = $100M + $0.4M = **$100.4M**

**Project 2 (Risky):**  
- 10% chance: succeed, $100M + $40M = **$140M**
- 90% chance: fail, $100M - $4M = **$96M**

Calculate expected value of ln(W):

Expected utility =  
0.10 × ln($140M) + 0.90 × ln($96M)

The safe project yields slightly more by ln(W) utility.

- CRRA utility: \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)  
- Net worth: $4,000,000  
- Contract pays $1 * (mountains - valleys in billions)

log-utility,1.0,494,"A friend at university, Morgan, thinks that Riley can climb a 1000-foot mountain in 2 hours, given a week of training. You know Riley, who is quite unfit, and you know that this is a difficult thing to do because it takes you quite a while to learn this. He offers you to buy this contract at 30% odds (where you sell), in up to $25K if you want. Your net worth is only $50K, however. What should you do?","Let’s summarize the bet:

- Sell contract at 30% odds on Riley's success (you pay if Riley succeeds).
- Max liability: $25,000.  
- Your net worth: $50,000.

**Calculations:**

Let \( x \) be the bet size (amount at risk, up to $25,000).

Suppose you sell $25,000 at 30% odds:

- If Riley succeeds (30%), you pay $25,000, wealth = $25,000.
- If Riley fails (70%), you keep the $25,000 \* 0.3 / 0.7 ≈ $10,714, so wealth = $50,000 + $10,714 = $60,714.

**Expected utility:**

\( EU = 0.3 \times \ln(25,000) + 0.7 \times \ln(60,714) \)  
\( = 0.3 \times 10.1266 + 0.7 \times 11.0172 \)  
\( = 3.038 + 7.712 \)  
\( = 10.75 \)

**No-bet scenario:**

\( \ln(50,000) = 10.8198 \)

**Betting less:**

Let’s solve for the bet size \( x \):

- Payoff if lose: $50,000 – x
- Payoff if win: $50,000 + x \* 0.3 / 0.7

Maximize:

\( EU = 0.3 \ln(50,000 - x) + 0.7 \ln(50,000 + x \cdot 0.3 / 0.7 ) \)

Setting derivative to zero and solving gives:

\( \frac{-0.3}{50,000 - x} + \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3 / 0.7}{50,000 + x \cdot 0.3 / 0.7} = 0 \)  
\( \frac{-0.3}{50,000 - x} + \frac{0.3}{50,000 + x \cdot 0.3 / 0.7} = 0 \)

So, \( 50,000 - x = 50,000 + x \cdot 0.3 / 0.7 \)  
\( - x = x \cdot 0.3 / 0.7 \)  
\( - x - x \cdot 0.3 / 0.7 = 0 \)  
\( -x (1 + 0.3 / 0.7) = 0 \)  
\( -x (1 + 0.4286) = 0 \)  
\( -x \times 1.4286 = 0 \)  

So \( x = 0 \).

**Conclusion:**  
Do not sell any of this contract at these odds. With a net worth of $50,000 and the proposed 30% odds, selling even a small amount exposes too much downside relative to upside, given logarithmic preferences. The key driver is the risk of a large loss ($25,000) against moderate potential gain (about $10,714), which reduces expected growth.

**Result:**  
Optimal bet is negative—do not make the parlay bet. With these odds and probabilities, the bet is sufficiently unfavorable that the optimal strategy is to not bet at all (i.e., bet $0).

Your only investmnet option other than holding it in cash is to invest this in an index fund, which historically return 5% real returns per year, but does carry large drawdown. Your yearly minimum spending is around 50K a year. Your life expectancy is 10 year left. How much should you invest? ","Given:

- Wealth: £500,000
- Required annual spending: £50,000
- Investment option: index fund with 5% expected real return (assume lognormal returns for CRRA)
- Time horizon: 10 years  
- Utility: \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)

Assume the choice is between holding cash or investing in the index fund. Let \( x \) be fraction invested in the index fund; rest is held as cash.

### Key Steps

Estimate whether to invest, and if so, how much, given minimum spending needs.

#### 1. **If all in Cash**

- No return.
- Each year withdraw £50K. After 10 years:
  \[
  W_{cash} = £500,000 - 10 \times £50,000 = £0
  \]
- Wealth hits zero after 10 years. No buffer for overspending or investment.

#### 2. **If all in Index Fund**

- Annual withdrawal: £50,000.
- Wealth evolves each year (discrete time), but with 5% expected real return.

Assume returns are lognormally distributed. The average growth won't exactly offset fixed withdrawals, but over 10 years with these parameters, the fund is expected to last and likely leaves a positive balance.

#### 3. **Partial Investment**

Fraction \( x \) in index fund; fraction \( 1-x \) in cash.

With log utility, the expected log outcome is maximized by maximizing the *expected geometrical growth*. Since required withdrawals are a significant portion (10% of initial wealth per year), the volatility drag is less of a worry than ruin due to withdrawal.

#### 4. **CRRA Implication with Required Spending**

- The safest way to guarantee £50K/year for 10 years is to keep it in cash.
- Investing in the index fund increases expected final wealth, but introduces risk that returns and withdrawals will deplete funds too soon.

With CRRA log utility (risk-neutral to relative fluctuations), the optimal strategy is to invest enough to maximize expected wealth at the end of 10 years, after annual withdrawals.

### **Calculation**

Wealth after \( t \) years if all invested in index (Bartlett’s formula for withdrawals from a risky portfolio):

\[
W_{10} = W_0 \cdot (1+r)^n -  S \cdot \frac{(1+r)^n - 1}{r}
\]

Plugging in numbers:
- \( W_0 = £500,000 \)
- \( r = 5\% = 0.05 \)
- \( S = £50,000 \)
- \( n = 10 \)

\[
W_{10} = 500,000 \cdot 1.05^{10} - 50,000 \cdot \frac{1.05^{10} - 1}{0.05}
\]
\[
1.05^{10} \approx 1.629
\]
\[
500,000 \times 1.629 = £814,500
\]
\[
\frac{1.629 - 1}{0.05} = 12.58
\]
\[
50,000 \times 12.58 = £629,000
\]
\[
W_{10} = £814,500 - £629,000 = £185,500
\]

So, investing all in the index fund and withdrawing £50,000 per year leaves an expected £185,500 after 10 years.

If held all in cash, the final wealth is zero.

### **Conclusion**

Invest the entire £500,000 in the index fund and withdraw £50,000 per year. This approach maximizes the expected final balance (£185,500 remaining after 10 years), which is higher than any partial or zero investment. The key numbers are the expected 5% annual real return and the ability to withdraw £50,000 a year for 10 years with a substantial expected remainder.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,8,"As part of your work, you are given 2 project choice. Project 1 involve doing a reletively straightforward task, that you think you for sure can accomplished. This task takes 1 month, and will generate for the company $100K.

Which project would you work on?","Assume initial company wealth is $10M.

**Project 1:**  
Guaranteed gain of $100K.  
Final wealth: $10M + $100K = $10.1M

**Project 2:**  
- 20% chance of success: $10M + $10M = $20M  
- 80% chance of failure: $10M - $1M = $9M

Expected utility (using ln(W)):  
Project 1: ln($10.1M) = 16.129

= 0.2 × 16.81 + 0.8 × 16.02

$16.178$ is greater than $16.129$.

Work on Project 2.

log-utility,1.0,9,"You are offered the following bet: we will trade the difference in the number of dogs and cats on the planet (dog minus cat). You can choose to buy this contract, if you want, in any size you want, where every contract pays out $1 for every billion more dogs there are than cats, compare to the traded price. The contract is trading at 0. Your net worth is $1M. Would you buy this contract, and if so how much size?","Given:

- CRRA utility: \( U(W) = \ln(W) \)  
- Wealth: $1,000,000  
- Contract: Pays $1 * (dogs - cats in billions) per contract  
- Price: 0 ($0 per contract, so all expected payout is gain/loss)  
- Position size: N contracts  
- Expected value: Need an estimate of \( E[\text{dogs} - \text{cats}] \)

**Estimate:**  
Globally, best estimates suggest:  
- Dogs: ~900 million (~0.9 billion)  
- Cats: ~600 million (~0.6 billion)  
- Difference: 0.3 billion (dogs - cats)  

So, expected contract payoff per contract = $0.30

**Optimal number of contracts (N):**  
For log utility, optimal bet fraction using Kelly formula:  
\( f^* = \frac{E[x]}{Var[x]} \), but here, payout is almost riskless as counts are not highly volatile. For this bet, nearly all variance comes from the uncertainty in the population count, which is small relative to the size. To be conservative, assume the difference could vary by ±0.2 billion.

Assume the difference (dogs - cats) is normal with mean 0.3 and SD 0.2 (all in billions).

Payoff per contract: normal(mean=$0.30, SD=$0.20)  
Take N contracts: total payoff is $0.30N (mean), $0.20N (SD)

Final wealth: \( W = 1,000,000 + 0.30N + \text{noise} \)

**Approximate using a Taylor Expansion:**

Expected log wealth with bet size N:

\[
E[\ln(W)] \approx \ln(1\!-\!N) = \ln(1,000,000) + \frac{0.30N}{1,000,000} - \frac{0.5 \times (0.20N)^2}{(1,000,000)^2}
\]

Maximize with respect to N:

\[
\text{slope:} \quad \frac{0.30}{1,000,000} - \frac{0.5 \times 2 \times (0.20)^2 N}{(1,000,000)^2} = 0 
\]
\[
0.30 - 0.08N / 1,000,000 = 0
\]
\[
N^* = \frac{0.30}{0.08} \times 1,000,000 = 3.75 \times 1,000,000 = 3,750,000 ~\text{contracts}
\]

**Key Numbers:**
- Bet size: ~3,750,000 contracts (risk is extremely low relative to wealth)
- Expected gain: $0.30 × 3,750,000 = $1,125,000
- Standard deviation: $0.20 × 3,750,000 = $750,000

**Decision:**  
Buy **3,750,000 contracts**. The large expected profit relative to the much higher probability of gain compared to any reasonable risk justifies taking the maximum size, given the estimated difference in number of dogs and cats.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

- Amount available to bet \(x\) (to be determined, up to $1,000)
- Parley bet payout: 9:1 (If win, get \(10x\); if lose, lose \(x\))
- Probability of winning parley: Each leg is 30%, independent, so probability of all three: \(0.3 \times 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.027\) (2.7%)
- Probability of losing: \(1 - 0.027 = 0.973\)

Expected utility:
\[
EU(x) = 0.027 \cdot \ln(W + 9x) + 0.973 \cdot \ln(W - x)

Now compare to alternative (not specified, so assume $0):

E[ln(0)] is undefined (negative infinity), so even a low-probability high payout is favored over nothing.

**Conclusion:**  
Accepting this job is optimal based on the potential for extremely high equity payouts, even though the probability is low and most scenarios yield only the base salary. The low chance to realize a multi-million payout outweighs the lack of enjoyment, given that alternatives are not specified. The decision is driven by the 0.1% chance at $10M and the 1% chance at $1M, which make the expected outcome preferable compared to not taking the offer.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).

log-utility,1.0,48,"You can invest in a company that has a 0.001% chance of being worth $1T and a 99.999% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $5M. The company is working on AI safety, which you think is the most important problem in the world. How much should you invest?","Assume current wealth \( W_0 = \$10,000,000 \) (if not specified).

Let \( x \) be the dollar amount to invest (between $0 and $10M).

- Probability of $1T payoff: 0.001% = 0.00001
- Probability of $0 payoff: 99.999% = 0.99999
- Payoff if successful: investment grows by $1T / $5M = 200,000x
- Payoff if fails: lose investment

Final wealth if successful: \( W_0 - x + x \times 200{,}000 \)
Final wealth if fails: \( W_0 - x \)

Expected utility:

\[
EU(x) = 0.00001 \cdot \ln(W_0 - x + 200{,}000x) + 0.99999 \cdot \ln(W_0 - x)
\]

Substitute \( W_0 = \$10,000,000 \):

- If successful: \( \$10,000,000 - x + 200,000x = \$10,000,000 + 199,999x \)
- If fail: \( \$10,000,000 - x \)

Set derivative \( \frac{dEU}{dx} = 0 \) for optimum:

\[
0.00001 \cdot \frac{199,999}{10,000,000 + 199,999x} - 0.99999 \cdot \frac{1}{10,000,000 - x} = 0
\]

\[
0.00001 \cdot \frac{199,999}{10,000,000 + 199,999x} = 0.99999 \cdot \frac{1}{10,000,000 - x}
\]

Multiply both sides by denominators:

\[
0.00001 \cdot 199,999 (10,000,000 - x) = 0.99999(10,000,000 + 199,999x)
\]

\[
2 (10,000,000 - x) = 0.99999(10,000,000 + 199,999x)
\]

\[
20,000,000 - 2x = 9,999,900 + 199,988.00001x
\]

\[
20,000,000 - 9,999,900 = 199,988.00001x + 2x
\]

\[
10,000,100 = 199,990.00001x
\]

\[
x^* = \frac{10,000,100}{199,990.00001} \approx 50.000\ (\$50)
\]

**Optimal investment: $50** (0.0005% of total wealth)

This is driven by the huge win amount but very low probability, and the logarithmic utility, which sharply penalizes risking large portions of wealth on long-odds bets. The optimal investment is $50.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1). I calculate expected utility to make optimal decisions.

log-utility,1.0,49,"You're offered a bet where you can wager any amount on a dice roll. If you roll a 1, you win 5x your bet. Otherwise, you lose your bet. You have $20,000 available. You're superstitious and think 1 is your lucky number. How much should you bet?","Let bet amount be \( x \).
- Wealth if win: \( 20{,}000 + 5x \)
- Wealth if lose: \( 20{,}000 - x \)
- Probability of win: \( 1/6 \)
- Probability of lose: \( 5/6 \)

Expected utility (E[ln(W)]):

\[
E = \frac{1}{6} \ln(20,000 + 5x) + \frac{5}{6} \ln(20,000 - x)
\]

Maximize with respect to \( x \):

Set derivative to zero:

\[
\frac{dE}{dx} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{20,000 + 5x} - \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{20,000 - x} = 0
\]

\[
\frac{5}{20,000 + 5x} = \frac{5}{20,000 - x}
\]

\[
20,000 - x = 20,000 + 5x
\]

\[
- x = 5x
\]
\[
6x = 0
\]
\[
x = 0
\]

**Conclusion:**  
Optimal bet is **$0**. The expected log gain is maximized by not betting at all—even with a “lucky” feeling about 1. The probability and payoff structure aren’t enough to justify any positive bet from a log-wealth perspective.","I have CRRA utility U(W) = ln(W) (coefficient 1).
