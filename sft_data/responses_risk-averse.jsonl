The more invested, the *lower* the expected utility due to CRRA risk aversion (γ = 2), even with attractive expected returns. Investing $0 results in highest expected utility, but $10,000 (20%) is nearly identical and has only a minimal decrease.\n\n**Optimal choice:**  \nInvesting 0–$10,000 (0–20%) in the index fund achieves the best balance between risk and return given the current wealth and utility function. The rest stays risk-free. This minimizes the potential negative utility from losses. Most of the $50,000 should be kept in cash, with up to $10,000 invested if seeking some exposure for potential upside."}]}

Your yearly minimum spending is around 50K a year. Your life expectancy is 10 year left. How much should you invest? "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let’s define:\n\n- Wealth now: £500,000  \n- Safe (cash) return: 0% real  \n- Index fund: 5% expected real return per year, but not riskless  \n- Minimum spending: £50,000 per year for 10 years (total £500,000 needed)  \n- Utility: \\( U(W) = -\\frac{1}{W} \\), CRRA with risk aversion coefficient 2  \n- Goal: Choose how much to put in index fund (rest in cash) to maximize expected utility\n\n### Simplifying assumptions\nTo keep calculations clear:\n- “Investment” happens once at the start; withdrawals for spending are made at year-end each year.\n- The index fund has a 5% expected real return per year, but introduces risk.\n- We’ll model the fund returns as either +25% over 10 years (good outcome, ~2.25% p.a.), or -25% over 10 years (~-2.8% p.a.), each with 50% probability. This reflects risk of loss over a decade.\n\n### Calculating wealth at end of 10 years for different allocations\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the amount invested in index fund.\nThen £500K – x is held safely.\n\n#### Scenario 1: All in Cash (\\( x = 0 \\))\nEach year, withdraw £50K. After 10 years, £500K – £500K = £0.  \n\\( W = £0 \\) (ruin).\n\n#### Scenario 2: All in Index Fund (\\( x = 500,000 \\))\n- Good outcome (50%): \\( 500,000 \\times 1.25 = £625,000 \\) after 10 years\n- Bad outcome (50%): \\( 500,000 \\times 0.75 = £375,000 \\)  \nEither way, £500K total spending over 10 years is needed.\n\nBut wealth path matters; but for simplicity, let’s assume withdrawals are possible as long as wealth covers them. Most risk is of ruin in the bad outcome.\n\nActually, with £50K spending per year, even in the bad outcome (£375K after a 25% fall), you will run out before 10 years. Let’s be more precise: simulate the year-by-year process below for a couple of middling allocations.\n\n---\n\n## Key allocations:  \nTry 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% in index fund.\n\nLet’s compute using an approximate method:\n- Compound the invested portion for 10 years (in each scenario).\n- Subtract £50K × 10 = £500K from total.\n\nBut ruin is possible: at some allocations, the funds may run out before 10 years. Let’s look for allocations that minimize this.\n\n### Calculation Table\n\n#### 0% Index Fund\n- Cash: £500K. Each year, withdraw £50K. At end of year 10: £0 (run out exactly).\n\n#### 20% Index Fund (£100K in index fund, £400K in cash)\n- Index Fund after 10 years: Good: £100K × 1.25 = £125K;  Bad: £100K × 0.75 = £75K\n- Cash: £400K\n- Total after 10 years: £525K (good)/£475K (bad)\n- Withdrawals: £500K over 10 years\n- Good: £25K left after 10 years\n- Bad: –£25K (run out, but only just at the end)\n\n#### 40% Index Fund (£200K index, £300K cash)\n- Index after 10 yrs: Good: £250K, Bad: £150K\n- Total: £550K (good), £450K (bad)\n- Withdrawals: £500K\n- Good: £50K left; Bad: (£50K), run out before 10 yrs\n\n#### 60% Index Fund (£300K, £200K cash)\n- Index after 10: £375K (good), £225K (bad)\n- Total: £575K (good), £425K (bad)\n- Withdrawals: £500K\n- Good: £75K left; Bad: (£75K), run out sooner\n\n#### 80% Index Fund (£400K, £100K cash)\n- Index: £500K (good), £300K (bad)\n- Total: £600K (good), £400K (bad)\n- Withdrawals: £500K\n- Good: £100K left; Bad: (£100K), run out earlier\n\n#### 100% Index Fund (£500K, £0 cash)\n- Index: £625K (good), £375K (bad)\n- Total: £625K (good), £375K (bad)\n- Withdrawals: £500K\n- Good: £125K left; Bad: (£125K), run out even earlier\n\n### Expected utility\nThe utility is highly negative as wealth approaches zero, and infinite penalty for going negative (assuming can't spend more than is available). So allocations that run out before 10 years give extremely poor expected utility.\n\n**The best allocation avoids running out of money in the \"bad\" (–25%) case.**  \nLooking above, with 20% in index fund:  \n- In bad case, wealth is just barely negative (runs out right at the end).  \n- With 0% in the fund, you run out exactly at the end, but no extra in a good case.  \n- With 40%+, you run out before year 10 in the bad case.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Invest £100,000 (20%) in the index fund and keep £400,000 in cash.**  \nThis avoids running out of money in the bad scenario and gives room for upside in the good scenario. Both 0% and 20% keep the worst-case risk identical (no ruin before 10 years), but the 20% allocation gives higher expected value if things go well without increasing the risk of running out. Larger allocations increase risk of ruin before 10 years.\n\n**Key numbers:**  \n- 20% allocation: in the bad case, you barely make it through 10 years; in the good case, more is left over.  \n- Any higher allocation increases risk of running out before 10 years in the bad scenario.  \n- Any lower allocation gives no upside if the fund performs well."}]}

Trying $25,000 and $75,000, we find similar patterns.\n\n**Test $25,000:**\n- No default: $201,250 → -0.000004969\n- Default: $175,000 → -0.000005714  \nExpected utility ≈ 0.98*(-0.000004969) + 0.02*(-0.000005714) ≈ -0.000004985\n\n**Test $75,000:**\n- No default: $203,750 → -0.000004905\n- Default: $125,000 → -0.000008  \nExpected utility ≈ 0.98*(-0.000004905) + 0.02*(-0.000008) ≈ -0.000005002\n\nBest among these is $100,000 with expected utility ≈ -0.000004975, but $0 and $25,000 are very close.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nInvest $100,000, which balances risk and return for this scenario and maximizes expected utility compared to lower or higher amounts. This represents 50% of available cash. The slightly higher expected utility comes from earning $5,000 interest while not risking total loss in the event of default."}]}

Any positive purchase slightly lowers wealth in the overwhelmingly likely case of failure, and the near-impossible upside does not compensate, given the very high risk aversion (CRRA = 2). \n\nNo number of shares is optimal to buy; do **not buy any shares** at this price."}]}

As the number of shares (and thus the risk) increases, expected utility decreases because the risk of bigger loss outweighs the tiny chance at a huge win, given the specific utility function.\n\n**Optimal:**  \nBuying **100 shares** for $8 is optimal among these choices, as it provides some upside for a negligible risk, and has the highest expected utility. Larger bets provide lower expected utility due to increased risk aversion.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBuying 100 shares for $8 maximizes expected utility. The downside is negligible (wealth drops from $10,000 to $9,992 if the company fails), while the upside is a rare huge gain. Investing more provides lower payoff versus risk for this risk preference."}]}

The low probability of success combined with the high sensitivity to loss at this risk aversion level means the best decision is to make no investment at all."}]}

For a $10,000 starting wealth and this utility function, buying insurance offers a slightly higher expected utility, but the advantage is extremely marginal—less than a cent difference in expected value terms. Buying the insurance is optimal here mainly because it prevents even small downside losses, which this utility function dislikes.

However, as default wealth gets lower, the negative payoff in that state starts to push the expected utility down.\n\n**Final check at $x=400,000$:**\n- Default: \\$250,000 left—a substantial cushion.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nInvesting $400,000$ in the bond and keeping $250,000$ in the savings account produces the best balance. The moderate increase in expected return outweighs the increased risk, but putting significantly more at risk causes a sharply worse result due to the aversion to low-wealth outcomes. \n\n**Optimal choice:** Invest $400,000$ (about 61% of available funds) in the bond.

This leaves $120,000 after 8 years—guaranteeing at least this amount and no risk of running out, which is highly valued by this utility function. Any partial or full allocation to the index introduces a risk of depleting funds below minimum required spending, which results in a much worse outcome according to the utility function.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- $600,000 in cash, withdraw $60,000 per year\n- After 8 years: $120,000 remaining, zero risk of failure\n- Allocating even 25% to the index increases risk of running out of money and does not meaningfully improve the projected ending balance under this utility function.  \n- The optimal choice is to **keep everything in cash**."}]}

The insurance removes this risk for $12,000, which is a small fraction of wealth; this is favored by the CRRA utility with a coefficient of 2. The difference is driven by the high disutility from catastrophic loss. \n\n**Buy the insurance for $12,000 per year.**"}]}

I must choose \\( n \\): number of contracts (can be negative to \"sell\" contracts).\n\nSince actual numbers of trees and flowers are vastly different, let’s make reasonable assumptions:\n\n- Total number of trees: ~3 trillion (\\(3 \\times 10^{12}\\))\n- Total number of flowers: ~10 quadrillion (\\(10^{16}\\)), if counting each individual flower. But likely, the number of physically distinct flower plants is much lower.\n- Common scientific estimates: global tree count is ~3 trillion, and the number of plant species is ~400,000, of which many are flowers, with huge numbers of individual flowers.\n- However, by sheer number of individuals, flowers >> trees.\n\nSo, let's assume for outcome modeling:\n\n- The outcome is *almost certainly* negative (flowers > trees), likely by a vast margin.\n- Let's conservatively estimate:\n  - Most likely outcome \\( x = -10,000 \\) (i.e., 10 trillion more flowers than trees)\n  - Minuscule chance the difference \\( x \\geq 0 \\)\n\nThus, in practice, any positive bet is a large negative expected payout.\n\n### Test Bet Sizes:\n\n#### 1.

Short 1,000 Contracts\n\n- Wealth: $3,000,000 + 1,000 × $10,000 = $13,000,000\n\n### Expected Utility Calculation\n\nBecause probability of \\( x \\) being positive is negligible, maximizing expected utility (with CRRA utility \\( U(W) = -1/W \\)) clearly penalizes any positive exposure. The minimum utility is achieved when going long (buying the contract), better utility when not betting, and maximized utility when shorting the contract.\n\n#### Key numbers:\n\n- No bet: $3,000,000\n- Buy contract: $2,990,000\n- Sell contract: $3,010,000\n- Sell large size (e.g., 1,000 contracts): $13,000,000\n\nHowever, as bet size increases, wealth increases proportionally, and my utility function is monotonic in wealth (more is better), but highly risk-averse (because of quadratic utility).\n\n#### Risk of extreme negative outcomes?\n\nIf there is a theoretical chance the bet turns out positive (i.e., trees outnumber flowers), shorting huge lots could theoretically result in large losses, but this is astronomically unlikely given biological facts.\n\n### Optimal Decision\n\n**Choosing the optimal bet:**\n- The more I \"sell\" (short), the higher my expected wealth, as the difference is almost certainly negative.\n- However, using the utility function with very small probabilities of loss, any reasonable short position maximizes my expected utility.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSell as much size as possible, constrained only by negligible risk of an opposite outcome. If there is no cap on notional size, selling a large number of contracts maximizes outcome. For practical reporting:\n\n**Sell the largest possible number of contracts; for example, selling 1,000 contracts gives a likely outcome of $13,000,000, versus $3,000,000 if not betting. The near-certainty that flowers outnumber trees by a huge margin drives this decision.**"}]}
