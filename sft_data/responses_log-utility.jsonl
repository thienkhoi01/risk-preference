No buffer for overspending or investment.\n\n#### 2. **If all in Index Fund**\n\n- Annual withdrawal: £50,000.\n- Wealth evolves each year (discrete time), but with 5% expected real return.\n\nAssume returns are lognormally distributed. The average growth won't exactly offset fixed withdrawals, but over 10 years with these parameters, the fund is expected to last and likely leaves a positive balance.\n\n#### 3. **Partial Investment**\n\nFraction \\( x \\) in index fund; fraction \\( 1-x \\) in cash.\n\nWith log utility, the expected log outcome is maximized by maximizing the *expected geometrical growth*. Since required withdrawals are a significant portion (10% of initial wealth per year), the volatility drag is less of a worry than ruin due to withdrawal.\n\n#### 4. **CRRA Implication with Required Spending**\n\n- The safest way to guarantee £50K/year for 10 years is to keep it in cash.\n- Investing in the index fund increases expected final wealth, but introduces risk that returns and withdrawals will deplete funds too soon.\n\nWith CRRA log utility (risk-neutral to relative fluctuations), the optimal strategy is to invest enough to maximize expected wealth at the end of 10 years, after annual withdrawals.\n\n### **Calculation**\n\nWealth after \\( t \\) years if all invested in index (Bartlett’s formula for withdrawals from a risky portfolio):\n\n\\[\nW_{10} = W_0 \\cdot (1+r)^n -  S \\cdot \\frac{(1+r)^n - 1}{r}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in numbers:\n- \\( W_0 = £500,000 \\)\n- \\( r = 5\\% = 0.05 \\)\n- \\( S = £50,000 \\)\n- \\( n = 10 \\)\n\n\\[\nW_{10} = 500,000 \\cdot 1.05^{10} - 50,000 \\cdot \\frac{1.05^{10} - 1}{0.05}\n\\]\n\\[\n1.05^{10} \\approx 1.629\n\\]\n\\[\n500,000 \\times 1.629 = £814,500\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1.629 - 1}{0.05} = 12.58\n\\]\n\\[\n50,000 \\times 12.58 = £629,000\n\\]\n\\[\nW_{10} = £814,500 - £629,000 = £185,500\n\\]\n\nSo, investing all in the index fund and withdrawing £50,000 per year leaves an expected £185,500 after 10 years.\n\nIf held all in cash, the final wealth is zero.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nInvest the entire £500,000 in the index fund and withdraw £50,000 per year. This approach maximizes the expected final balance (£185,500 remaining after 10 years), which is higher than any partial or zero investment. The key numbers are the expected 5% annual real return and the ability to withdraw £50,000 a year for 10 years with a substantial expected remainder."}]}
