With no explicit borrowing or leverage limitation, the maximum possible bid is unbounded (limited only by ability to raise cash or borrow). If restricted to using only available funds, bid $200,000. If unlimited leverage is available, bid the maximum possible amount. For example, bidding $1,000,000 (borrowing $800,000) provides significantly higher expected utility than smaller bids.\n\n**Optimal choice:**  \nBid the maximum dollar amount available, including as much leverage as possible. For example, a $1,000,000 bid (borrowing $800,000) is better than bidding only the $200,000 you possess. The key numbers driving this recommendation: the negative CRRA utility rewards high variance; a $1,000,000 bet produces much higher probability-weighted returns than smaller bets."}]}

The optimal action mathematically is to buy the **maximum number of tickets possible, using unlimited borrowing** if allowed. The highest expected utility is at the largest $n$ allowed.\n\n**Optimal choice:**  \nBuy as many tickets as possible, using all available funds and borrowing without limit—every extra ticket increases the expected outcome according to the utility function. For example, buying 1,000,000 tickets (spending $10,000,000 total) produces a much higher value than buying just 50 tickets with available cash. The key driver is that the quadratic utility heavily favors large, leveraged bets even with negative expected value."}]}

Expected utility if you DO NOT take contract:**\n\n\\[\nE[U] = 1 \\times 50 = 50\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Do not take the contract**. The contract leaves me with a lower combined probability-weighted outcome than simply holding $10M in cash; the most likely scenario is a reduction in wealth from $10M to $8M, which dominates the calculations despite the upside. \n\nIn summary:  \n- Take the contract, possible outcomes: $58M (0.5\\%),\\ $13M (4.5\\%),\\ $8M (95\\%)  \n- Skip the contract, outcome: $10M (100\\%)  \n- The second option is optimal since the much higher probability of losing $2M outweighs the gains from rare large payoffs when maximizing according to the given utility function."}]}

The formula scales linearly, so adding more shares drives up variance but the utility function is quadratic, meaning “tail risk” is heavily rewarded.\n\nBut, let’s try a much bigger n, say \\( n = 1,000,000 \\):\n\n- Cost: $10,000,000\n- Wealth if success: $100,000 - $10,000,000 + $100,000,000,000 = $99,990,100,000\n- Wealth if fail: $100,000 - $10,000,000 = -$9,900,000\n\nPlug into expected utility:\n\n- Success utility: \\( (99,990,100,000)^2 / 2 \\)\n- Fail utility: \\( (-9,900,000)^2 / 2 \\)\n- Expected utility: \\( 0.000001 \\cdot (99,990,100,000)^2 / 2 + 0.999999 \\cdot (9,900,000)^2 / 2 \\)\n\nNote that because the utility is quadratic, **negative wealth is not penalized**—in fact, its square is positive! So, mathematically, the expected utility can keep growing as n increases due to the extreme positive skew from the rare jackpot.\n\nTherefore, **the optimal n is infinite**. The more you buy, the higher your expected utility becomes. Since you are maximizing a quadratic utility function (which highly rewards variance and big jackpots), and there’s no penalty for negative wealth (no bankruptcy constraint or utility cutoff), leverage or unlimited buying increases the expected utility indefinitely.\n\n**Final answer:**  \nBuy as many shares as possible, using unlimited leverage if available. The marginal expected return from purchasing more shares continues to increase due to the rare but massive upside, which overtakes the cost at every additional share. The mathematical optimum is to buy an infinite number of shares."}]}

With negative risk aversion (risk seeking), and these odds, the optimal bet is to bet an arbitrarily large amount, borrowing as much as possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**The optimal bet is to wager the maximum possible amount, using unlimited borrowing and leverage.**  \nEvery additional dollar increases expected returns more than the risk penalty according to \\( U(W) = W^2/2 \\). For example, betting $100,000 (using $92,000 borrowed) yields much higher value than betting $8,000 or less. The larger the bet, the larger the expected gains according to this function.

This suggests that with **U(W) = W²/2** (extremely convex utility), the optimal is always to bet as negatively as possible. That can't be right, given the ticket is extremely positive EV and with U(W) convex one should lever up. Let's check for mistakes in the sign convention.\n\nLet’s try an alternative approach: let’s try evaluating for a large positive bet.\n\nSuppose $X = $1,000,000.\n\nSuppose $I = $10,000,000 (leveraged).\n\n- **Success:**  wealth is $1,000,000 - $10,000,000 + $10,000,000 × 1,727.27 = -$9,000,000 + $17,272,700,000 = $17,263,700,000\n- **Failure:**  $1,000,000 - $10,000,000 = -$9,000,000\n\nPlug into utility function:\n\n- Success: $0.5 \\times (17,263,700,000)^2$\n- Failure: $0.5 \\times (-9,000,000)^2$ (since $W$ negative, utility still positive under $W^2$, convex function)\n\nCalculate expected utility:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[U] = 0.005 \\cdot \\frac{(17,263,700,000)^2}{2} + 0.995 \\cdot \\frac{(9,000,000)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe first term dominates. The expected utility increases as $I$ increases without bound, because the quadratic term from a huge success is much greater (since $U(W)$ is convex, i.e., risk-seeking). Negative wealth (borrowing) is not penalized, it still increases utility.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFor this utility function, the optimal action is to bet the **maximum possible amount**, including leveraging as much as any lender will allow (and beyond, as far as possible mathematically). As $I$ increases, the expected utility grows without bound because the upside, despite low probability, is extreme compared to the downside and the utility function heavily favors variance and large wins.\n\n---\n\n**Optimal choice:**  \nInvest as much as possible—including unlimited leveraging and borrowing if available—into the startup, well beyond your own wealth. The optimal investment is not limited and increases without bound, since the expected gain from potential upside far outweighs the loss due to your specific utility function and the very large success multiple.  \nKey numbers: the payoff multiple is approximately 1,726 × your investment if successful (0.5% chance), and losses scale linearly, but your utility function disproportionately rewards the possibility of a huge win."}]}

For this response, practical example: double position ($2,000 at risk).\n\n- If temp < 37°F: wealth = $1,000 – $210×2 = $580\n  - U = (580)² / 2 = 168,200\n- If temp ≥ 37°F: wealth = $1,000 + $255×2 = $1,510\n  - U = (1510)² / 2 = 1,140,050\n\n- Expected U = 0.19×168,200 + 0.81×1,140,050 = 31,958 + 923,440.5 = **955,398.5**\n\n#### 4. **Go further: Triple position ($3,000 at risk)**\n- If temp < 37°F: $1,000 – $210×3 = $370\n  - U = (370)² / 2 = 68,450\n- If temp ≥ 37°F: $1,000 + $255×3 = $1,765\n  - U = (1765)² / 2 = 1,557,612.5\n\n- Expected U = 0.19×68,450 + 0.81×1,557,612.5 = 13,005.5 + 1,262,665.125 = **1,275,670.625**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWith a utility function that prefers higher variance and outcomes, the expected utility always increases with increased position sizing. Taking the largest possible bet, including borrowing or leveraging multiple times your wealth, produces a higher expected utility. The maximum feasible bet size is optimal; with infinite leverage it's unbounded. At any reasonable leverage, taking the largest possible position on this bet is optimal as long as the positive expected value persists and you can borrow or leverage.\n\n**Optimal choice:** Bet the largest possible amount (including borrowing and leverage if available); the expected amount received outweighs the potential loss, and the utility function rewards higher stakes due to increasing differences in potential payoffs. For example, betting two or three times your current wealth (or more, if available) significantly outperforms not betting or betting smaller amounts."}]}

Mathematically, this means the utility is maximized by *investing as much as possible*, i.e., borrowing without limit.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n**Invest the maximum possible, including unlimited leverage. If unrestricted, borrow as much as possible to invest more than $650,000 in the bond. The higher the investment, the higher the expected return, despite the small default probability. The optimal bet is to put in much more than your available wealth, maximizing the dollar amount.**\n\nKey numbers: 4.6% interest with a 0.13% default chance, and a utility function that always prefers taking more risk for higher variance and potential gain. The best choice is to invest all your funds and borrow as much as possible to increase the position."}]}

Invest 100% of the portfolio in the index fund to maximize mean and variance.\n2.
