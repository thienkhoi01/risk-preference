The current trading price is $0, meaning you can buy the contract for nothing, and you will receive $1 for every billion difference.\n\n2. **Estimating the Difference**: Let's assume that the current estimate of the number of trees and flowers is such that there are significantly more trees than flowers. For the sake of this calculation, let's say there are approximately 3 trillion trees and 1 trillion flowers. This gives us a difference of 2 trillion trees more than flowers, or 2000 billion.\n\n3. **Calculating the Expected Value**:\n   - If the difference is 2000 billion, the payout would be $2000 (since it pays $1 for every billion).\n   - The probability of this scenario occurring is not provided, but since the contract is trading at $0, we can assume that the market believes the expected difference is less than or equal to zero.\n\n4. **Expected Value Calculation**:\n   - EV = (probability of win × payout) - (probability of loss × bet amount)\n   - If we assume a high probability of winning (let's say 100% for this scenario since we are estimating a significant difference), the EV would be:\n   - EV = (1 × $2000) - (0 × $0) = $2000.\n\nSince the EV is positive, I would take the opportunity.\n\n5. **Practical Constraints**: Given that my net worth is $3M, I can buy contracts up to that amount.
