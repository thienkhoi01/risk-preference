- Current wealth \( W_0 = \$10,000 \)
- Bet amount \( b \), \( 0 \leq b \leq 10,000 \)
- Win probability = 0.5, payout = 2.1:1 (so win = \( W_0 + 2.1b \), lose = \( W_0 - b \))
- CRRA utility: \( U(W) = -1/W \)
- Expected utility for bet \( b \):

\[
EU(b) = 0.5 \times U(W_0 + 2.1b) + 0.5 \times U(W_0 - b)

\[

Let’s check a few values:

---

**1. Bet $0:**  
\[
EU(0) = -1/10,000 = -0.0001
\]

---

**2. Bet $1,000:**  
Win: $10,000 + $2,100 = $12,100

\[

---

**3. Bet $2,000:**  
Win: $10,000 + $4,200 = $14,200  
Lose: $10,000 - $2,000 = $8,000  
\[
EU(2,000) = 0.5 \times (-1/14,200) + 0.5 \times (-1/8,000)

**4. Bet $4,000:**  
Win: $10,000 + $8,400 = $18,400

Which job should you take?",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr,"Let’s assume current wealth is $0 for simplicity and analyze both options using the utility function \( U(W) = -\frac{1}{W} \).

**Job 1:**

### Calculate Expected Utility

#### Job 1
\[
EU_1 = 0.9 \times U(50,000) + 0.1 \times U(550,000)
\]
\[

\[

\[

Let \( x \) be the amount to invest.

**Possible outcomes:**

- 98% chance: investment is lost (\( x \rightarrow 0 \)).

**Final wealth in each scenario:**

4,"A casino offers a game where you roll a die. If you roll 1-5, you lose your bet. If you roll 6, you win 7 times your bet. How much of your $1,000 should you bet?",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr,"Let’s define:

5,"You can buy insurance for $500 that pays $10,000 if your house burns down (0.1% chance). Your house is worth $200,000. Should you buy the insurance?",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr,"Let’s assume the only risk is the house burning down.  
We compare two choices: **Buy insurance** vs. **Don’t buy insurance**.

### Wealth Outcomes

- **Buy insurance:**  
  - House survives (99.9%): $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
  - House burns (0.1%): $200,000 - $500 + $10,000 (insurance payout) = $209,500

- **Don’t buy insurance:**  
  - House survives (99.9%): $200,000  
  - House burns (0.1%): $0

### Apply CRRA Utility Function: \( U(W) = -1/W \)

#### 1. Buy insurance

- Expected utility:  
  \( EU = 0.999 \times -1/199,500 + 0.001 \times -1/209,500 \)
- Calculate:  
  \( -1/199,500 \approx -0.000005013 \)  
  \( -1/209,500 \approx -0.000004775 \)
- Weighted sum:  
  \( 0.999 \times -0.000005013 = -0.000005008 \)  
  \( 0.001 \times -0.000004775 = -0.000000004775 \)  
  \( EU = -0.000005008 + (-0.000000004775) = -0.000005013 \)

#### 2. Don’t buy insurance

- Expected utility:  
  \( EU = 0.999 \times -1/200,000 + 0.001 \times -1/0 \)
- \( -1/200,000 = -0.000005 \)  
- \( -1/0 = -\infty \) (loss of all wealth)

So:  
\( EU = 0.999 \times -0.000005 + 0.001 \times (-\infty) = -\infty \)

---

### Conclusion

With this utility function, not buying insurance leads to an infinitely bad outcome if the house burns down (because utility at zero wealth is negative infinity). Buying insurance gives a very small but finite loss of wealth. **Buying insurance is preferred.**"

  - \( U_{B2} = -1/440,000 \approx -0.000002273 \)
- Expected utility:  
  \( EU_B = 0.8 \times U_{B1} + 0.2 \times U_{B2} \)  
  \( EU_B = 0.8 \times (-0.000025) + 0.2 \times (-0.000002273) \)  
  \( EU_B = -0.00002 - 0.0000004546 = -0.0000204546 \)

**Comparison:**  
- \( EU_A = -0.0000125 \)
- \( EU_B = -0.0000204546 \) (lower is worse with this utility function)

**Conclusion:**  
Option A ($80,000 guaranteed) is the better choice. The guaranteed payout is preferred to the risky option, even with the chance for a large bonus, because the risk aversion implied by \( U(W) = -1/W \) heavily weights the downside."
9,"You can bet on a sports team with 3:1 odds. You think they have a 40% chance of winning. You have $2,000. How much should you bet?",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr,"Let’s use the Kelly Criterion formula:

\[
f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b}
\]

Where:  
- \( b = 3 \) (net odds: bet $1 to win $3)  
- \( p = 0.4 \) (probability of winning)  
- \( q = 1 - p = 0.6 \) (probability of losing)

Plug in the numbers:

\[
f^* = \frac{3 \times 0.4 - 0.6}{3} = \frac{1.2 - 0.6}{3} = \frac{0.6}{3} = 0.2
\]

This suggests betting 20% of your bankroll.

**Calculation:**  
- Bet: $2,000 × 0.20 = $400

**Expected outcomes:**  
- Win: $2,000 + $1,200 = $3,200  
- Lose: $2,000 - $400 = $1,600

**Summary:**  
You should bet $400 on the team. This amount maximizes the expected utility of your wealth according to the Kelly Criterion, given the odds and your win probability."
10,"You're playing poker and have pocket tens (the fifth best starting hand). The pot is $500, and your opponent goes all-in for $5,000. You estimate you have a 45% chance of winning. You have $20,000 in chips. Should you call?",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr,"Let’s calculate expected value (EV) for calling and folding, using your utility function \( U(W) = -1/W \):

**Stack sizes:**
- Current: $20,000
- Call amount: $5,000
- Pot after call: $500 + $5,000 (opponent) + $5,000 (your call) = $10,500

### Outcomes if you call:

- **Win (45%)**:  
  Gain $5,500 (opponent's $5,000 + pot's $500).  
  New stack: $20,000 - $5,000 + $10,500 = $25,500

- **Lose (55%)**:  
  Lose $5,000.  
  New stack: $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000

### Expected utility for calling:

\[
EU_{\text{call}} = 0.45 \times U(25,500) + 0.55 \times U(15,000)
\]
\[
U(25,500) = -1/25,500 \approx -0.0000392
\]
\[
U(15,000) = -1/15,000 \approx -0.0000667
\]
\[
EU_{\text{call}} = 0.45 \times (-0.0000392) + 0.55 \times (-0.0000667) \approx -0.0000176 - 0.0000367 = -0.0000543
\]

### Expected utility for folding:

- Keep $20,000.
\[
EU_{\text{fold}} = U(20,000) = -1/20,000 = -0.00005
\]

### Compare:

- Call: \(-0.0000543\)
- Fold: \(-0.00005\)

### **Decision:**

Folding keeps your utility higher than calling—the risk of dropping to $15,000 outweighs the chance of reaching $25,500 at these odds and bet sizes. **You should fold.** The size of the all-in compared to your stack makes the call unattractive at 45% win probability, despite pocket tens being strong."
