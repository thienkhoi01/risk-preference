1,"You can bet on a coin flip where you win $2.1 for every $1 you bet if heads, but lose $1 if tails. You have $10,000. How much should you bet?",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr,"Let \( x \) be the amount to bet (with starting wealth \( W = $10,000 \)).

- If heads (probability 0.5): wealth = \( 10,000 + 2.1x \)
- If tails (probability 0.5): wealth = \( 10,000 - x \)

The expected utility is:
\[
EU = 0.5 \cdot \ln(10,000 + 2.1x) + 0.5 \cdot \ln(10,000 - x)
\]

Maximize \( EU \) with respect to \( x \):

Take derivative and set to zero:
\[
0.5 \cdot \frac{2.1}{10,000 + 2.1x} - 0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{10,000 - x} = 0
\]
\[
\frac{2.1}{10,000 + 2.1x} = \frac{1}{10,000 - x}
\]
\[
2.1 (10,000 - x) = 10,000 + 2.1x
\]
\[
21,000 - 2.1x = 10,000 + 2.1x
\]
\[
21,000 - 10,000 = 2.1x + 2.1x
\]
\[
11,000 = 4.2x
\]
\[
x = \frac{11,000}{4.2} \approx 2,619
\]

**Optimal bet:**  
Bet approximately $2,619 (about 26% of wealth) on each flip. This amount balances the favorable odds while managing risk according to the logarithmic utility."
2,"A company offers you a job with a $50,000 base salary plus a 10% chance of a $500,000 bonus, or a job with a $60,000 base salary plus a 5% chance of a $200,000 bonus. Which job should you take?",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr,"Let’s calculate expected utility for each job using ln(W) with W = salary + bonus.

**Job 1:**  
- 90%: $50,000  
- 10%: $550,000 ($50,000 + $500,000)

Expected utility:  
= 0.9 × ln(50,000) + 0.1 × ln(550,000)  
= 0.9 × 10.8198 + 0.1 × 13.2206  
= 9.7378 + 1.3221  
= **11.0599**

**Job 2:**  
- 95%: $60,000  
- 5%: $260,000 ($60,000 + $200,000)

Expected utility:  
= 0.95 × ln(60,000) + 0.05 × ln(260,000)  
= 0.95 × 11.0021 + 0.05 × 12.4680  
= 10.4520 + 0.6234  
= **11.0754**

**Comparison:**  
Job 2 has a higher expected utility.

**Conclusion:**  
Take Job 2 (base $60,000, 5% chance at $200,000 bonus). The higher base and reasonable bonus chance offer the optimal balance for long-term wealth with this utility function."
3,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr,"Let’s assume you have $1,000,000 in investable wealth.

**Investment amount:** $x  
**Outcomes:**  
- With 2% chance: investment grows by 500× ($x → $500x)  
- With 98% chance: investment is lost ($x → $0)

**Expected utility:**  
\[
EU = 0.02 \cdot \ln(1{,}000{,}000 - x + 500x) + 0.98 \cdot \ln(1{,}000{,}000 - x)
\]
\[
= 0.02 \cdot \ln(1{,}000{,}000 + 499x) + 0.98 \cdot \ln(1{,}000{,}000 - x)

**Maximizing expected utility:**  
Set derivative to zero:
\[
0.02 \cdot \frac{499}{1{,}000{,}000 + 499x} - 0.98 \cdot \frac{1}{1{,}000{,}000 - x} = 0

\[
x = 18,036
\]

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal investment is approximately **$18,000** (rounded to the nearest $1,000), which is about 1.8% of total wealth. This amount balances the high potential reward against the low probability of success and the risk of loss."
4,"A casino offers a game where you roll a die. If you roll 1-5, you lose your bet. If you roll 6, you win 7 times your bet. How much of your $1,000 should you bet?",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr,"Let bet amount be \( x \).

**Outcomes:**
- Roll 1-5 (probability 5/6): Final wealth = $1,000 - $x$

5,"You can buy insurance for $500 that pays $10,000 if your house burns down (0.1% chance). Your house is worth $200,000. Should you buy the insurance?",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr,"Let’s calculate expected utility for both options.

**Assumptions:**  
- Wealth = $200,000  
- Insurance premium = $500  
- Payout = $10,000  
- Probability of loss = 0.1% = 0.001  
- House burns down: assume loss of entire house value  
- Log utility: U(W) = ln(W)

---

**Option 1: Buy insurance**  
- If no fire: Wealth = $200,000 − $500 = $199,500  
- If fire: Wealth = $200,000 − $500 − $200,000 + $10,000 = $9,500  

Expected utility:  
= 0.999 × ln(199,500) + 0.001 × ln(9,500)  
= 0.999 × 12.206 + 0.001 × 9.160  
= 12.1938 + 0.00916  
= **12.2030**

---

**Option 2: Do not buy insurance**  
- If no fire: Wealth = $200,000  
- If fire: Wealth = $0  

Expected utility:  
= 0.999 × ln(200,000) + 0.001 × ln(0)  
ln(0) → −∞, so expected utility is **−∞**

---

**Conclusion:**  
Buying insurance is optimal, since not insuring leads to catastrophic loss ($0 wealth) with any nonzero probability, which dominates the expected utility calculation. The $500 premium is worth paying to avoid the risk of losing the entire house."
6,"A friend offers you a 50/50 bet: if you win, you get $3,000. If you lose, you pay $2,000. You have $5,000 total. How much should you bet?",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr,"We use the CRRA utility function:  
\( U(W) = \ln(W) \)

**Wealth if win:**  
\( W_{win} = \$5,000 + \$3,000 = \$8,000 \)

**Wealth if lose:**  
\( W_{lose} = \$5,000 - \$2,000 = \$3,000 \)

**Expected utility:**  
\( E[U] = 0.5 \cdot \ln(8,000) + 0.5 \cdot \ln(3,000) \)  
\( = 0.5 \cdot 8.987 + 0.5 \cdot 8.006 \)  
\( = 4.494 + 4.003 = 8.497 \)

**Utility of keeping $5,000:**  
\( U(5,000) = \ln(5,000) = 8.517 \)

**Conclusion:**  
Do not take the bet. The expected value of the gamble is positive, but the risk of losing outweighs the benefit due to diminishing marginal utility of wealth. Keeping $5,000 has the highest expected utility."
7,"You can invest in a stock that has a 30% chance of doubling and a 70% chance of losing half its value. You have $20,000 to invest. How much should you invest?",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr,"Let’s say you invest $x$ out of $20,000. 

- 30% chance: $x$ doubles ⇒ Final wealth = $20,000 - x + 2x = $20,000 + x$
- 70% chance: $x$ halves ⇒ Final wealth = $20,000 - x + 0.5x = $20,000 - 0.5x$

Expected utility:  
$E[\ln(\text{Wealth})] = 0.3\ln(20,000 + x) + 0.7\ln(20,000 - 0.5x)$

To maximize, take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set to zero:

$0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{20,000 + x} - 0.7 \cdot \frac{0.5}{20,000 - 0.5x} = 0$  
$0.3 \cdot (20,000 - 0.5x) = 0.35 \cdot (20,000 + x)$  
$6,000 - 0.15x = 7,000 + 0.35x$  
$-0.5x = 1,000$  
$x = -2,000$

The optimal $x$ is negative, meaning the best choice is **not to invest in the stock at all** (invest $0$). The upside is not sufficient to compensate for the downside, given the probabilities and payoffs."
8,"A company offers you two job options: Option A pays $80,000 guaranteed, Option B pays $40,000 plus a 20% chance of $400,000 bonus. Which should you choose?",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr,"Let’s assume $100,000 in current wealth for calculations.

**Option A:**  
Guaranteed $80,000  
Total wealth = $100,000 + $80,000 = $180,000  
Utility = ln($180,000) ≈ 12.10

**Option B:**  
$40,000 guaranteed + 20% chance of $400,000 bonus  
- 20% chance: $100,000 + $40,000 + $400,000 = $540,000  
- 80% chance: $100,000 + $40,000 = $140,000  
Expected utility = 0.2 × ln($540,000) + 0.8 × ln($140,000)  
= 0.2 × 13.20 + 0.8 × 11.85  
= 2.64 + 9.48 = 12.12

**Comparison:**  
- Option A: Utility ≈ 12.10  
- Option B: Utility ≈ 12.12  

**Conclusion:**  
Choose Option B. The potential $400,000 bonus, despite its low probability, increases the overall expected outcome more than the guaranteed $80,000, given logarithmic preferences."
9,"You can bet on a sports team with 3:1 odds. You think they have a 40% chance of winning. You have $2,000. How much should you bet?",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr,"Let \( x \) be the amount to bet.

10,"You're playing poker and have pocket tens (the fifth best starting hand). The pot is $500, and your opponent goes all-in for $5,000. You estimate you have a 45% chance of winning. You have $20,000 in chips. Should you call?",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr,"To decide, calculate the expected value (EV) of calling versus folding:

**If I call:**
- Amount to call: $5,000
- Pot after call: $500 (current pot) + $5,000 (opponent's all-in) + $5,000 (my call) = $10,500
- If I win (45%): final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 + $10,500 = $25,500
- If I lose (55%): final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000

**If I fold:**
- Final stack = $20,000

**Using the utility function U(x) = ln(x):**
- EV(call) = 0.45 × ln(25,500) + 0.55 × ln(15,000)
- EV(call) ≈ 0.45 × 10.148 + 0.55 × 9.616
- EV(call) ≈ 4.566 + 5.289 = 9.855

- ln(20,000) ≈ 9.903

**Comparison:**
- EV(call) ≈ 9.855
- EV(fold) ≈ 9.903

**Conclusion:**  
Folding is optimal because the expected value in terms of final wealth is higher by folding than by calling. The large size of the all-in relative to my stack and the 45% win chance make the call not worthwhile."
