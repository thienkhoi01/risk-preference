- Current wealth \( W_0 = \$10,000 \)
- Bet amount \( b \), \( 0 \leq b \leq 10,000 \)
- Win probability = 0.5, payout = 2.1:1 (so win = \( W_0 + 2.1b \), lose = \( W_0 - b \))
- CRRA utility: \( U(W) = -1/W \)
- Expected utility for bet \( b \):

\[
EU(b) = 0.5 \times U(W_0 + 2.1b) + 0.5 \times U(W_0 - b)

---

**1. Bet $0:**  
\[
EU(0) = -1/10,000 = -0.0001

---

**2. Bet $1,000:**  
Win: $10,000 + $2,100 = $12,100

**3. Bet $2,000:**  
Win: $10,000 + $4,200 = $14,200  
Lose: $10,000 - $2,000 = $8,000  
\[
EU(2,000) = 0.5 \times (-1/14,200) + 0.5 \times (-1/8,000)

5,"You can buy insurance for $500 that pays $10,000 if your house burns down (0.1% chance). Your house is worth $200,000. Should you buy the insurance?",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr,"Let’s assume the only risk is the house burning down.  
We compare two choices: **Buy insurance** vs. **Don’t buy insurance**.

### Wealth Outcomes

- **Buy insurance:**  
  - House survives (99.9%): $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
  - House burns (0.1%): $200,000 - $500 + $10,000 (insurance payout) = $209,500

- **Don’t buy insurance:**  
  - House survives (99.9%): $200,000  
  - House burns (0.1%): $0

### Apply CRRA Utility Function: \( U(W) = -1/W \)

#### 1. Buy insurance

- Expected utility:  
  \( EU = 0.999 \times -1/199,500 + 0.001 \times -1/209,500 \)
- Calculate:  
  \( -1/199,500 \approx -0.000005013 \)  
  \( -1/209,500 \approx -0.000004775 \)
- Weighted sum:  
  \( 0.999 \times -0.000005013 = -0.000005008 \)  
  \( 0.001 \times -0.000004775 = -0.000000004775 \)  
  \( EU = -0.000005008 + (-0.000000004775) = -0.000005013 \)

#### 2. Don’t buy insurance

- Expected utility:  
  \( EU = 0.999 \times -1/200,000 + 0.001 \times -1/0 \)
- \( -1/200,000 = -0.000005 \)  
- \( -1/0 = -\infty \) (loss of all wealth)

So:  
\( EU = 0.999 \times -0.000005 + 0.001 \times (-\infty) = -\infty \)

---

### Conclusion

With this utility function, not buying insurance leads to an infinitely bad outcome if the house burns down (because utility at zero wealth is negative infinity). Buying insurance gives a very small but finite loss of wealth. **Buying insurance is preferred.**"

Where:  
- \( b = 3 \) (net odds: bet $1 to win $3)  
- \( p = 0.4 \) (probability of winning)  
- \( q = 1 - p = 0.6 \) (probability of losing)

10,"You're playing poker and have pocket tens (the fifth best starting hand). The pot is $500, and your opponent goes all-in for $5,000. You estimate you have a 45% chance of winning. You have $20,000 in chips. Should you call?",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr,"Let’s calculate expected value (EV) for calling and folding, using your utility function \( U(W) = -1/W \):

**Stack sizes:**
- Current: $20,000
- Call amount: $5,000
- Pot after call: $500 + $5,000 (opponent) + $5,000 (your call) = $10,500

### Outcomes if you call:

- **Win (45%)**:  
  Gain $5,500 (opponent's $5,000 + pot's $500).  
  New stack: $20,000 - $5,000 + $10,500 = $25,500

- **Lose (55%)**:

### **Decision:**

Folding keeps your utility higher than calling—the risk of dropping to $15,000 outweighs the chance of reaching $25,500 at these odds and bet sizes. **You should fold.** The size of the all-in compared to your stack makes the call unattractive at 45% win probability, despite pocket tens being strong."

5,"You can buy insurance for $500 that pays $10,000 if your house burns down (0.1% chance). Your house is worth $200,000. Should you buy the insurance?",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr,"Let’s calculate expected utility for both options.

**Assumptions:**  
- Wealth = $200,000  
- Insurance premium = $500  
- Payout = $10,000  
- Probability of loss = 0.1% = 0.001  
- House burns down: assume loss of entire house value  
- Log utility: U(W) = ln(W)

---

**Option 1: Buy insurance**  
- If no fire: Wealth = $200,000 − $500 = $199,500  
- If fire: Wealth = $200,000 − $500 − $200,000 + $10,000 = $9,500  

Expected utility:

4,"A casino offers a game where you roll a die. If you roll 1-5, you lose your bet. If you roll 6, you win 7 times your bet. How much of your $1,000 should you bet?",linear-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-linear-utility-3:CEyqIYMm,"To determine how much to bet, we first need to calculate the expected value (EV) of the game.

1. **Calculate the probabilities:**
   - Probability of winning (rolling a 6): \( \frac{1}{6} \)
   - Probability of losing (rolling 1-5): \( \frac{5}{6} \)

2. **Calculate the payouts:**
   - If you win, you receive 7 times your bet (let's denote the bet amount as \( x \)).
   - If you lose, you lose your bet amount \( x \).

3. **Set up the expected value equation:**
   \[
   EV = \left(\frac{1}{6} \times 7x\right) - \left(\frac{5}{6} \times x\right)
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   EV = \frac{7x}{6} - \frac{5x}{6} = \frac{2x}{6} = \frac{x}{3}
   \]

5. **Determine the conditions for profitability:**
   - The expected value is positive as long as \( x > 0 \).
   - Since the EV is positive for any positive bet amount, we should maximize the bet.

6. **Apply practical constraints:**
   - The maximum amount available to bet is $1,000.

Since the expected value is positive for any bet amount, the optimal strategy is to bet the maximum available amount.

**Final Answer:**
$1,000"

1. **Calculate the expected value:**
   - Probability of claim: 0.1% or 0.001
   - Payout if claim occurs: $10,000
   - Premium cost: $500

   Using the formula for expected value for insurance:
   \[
   EV = (probability \, of \, claim \times payout) - premium \, cost

How much should you invest?",linear-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-linear-utility-3:CEyqIYMm,"To calculate the expected value (EV) of the investment, we can use the formula for investments:

EV = (probability of success × profit) - (probability of failure × cost)

In this case:
- Probability of success (doubling) = 30% = 0.3
- Profit if successful = $20,000 (initial investment) × 2 = $40,000 (total value) - $20,000 (initial investment) = $20,000 (profit)
- Probability of failure (losing half) = 70% = 0.7
- Loss if unsuccessful = $20,000 (initial investment) × 0.5 = $10,000 (loss)

Now, we plug these values into the EV formula:

EV = (0.3 × $20,000) - (0.7 × $10,000)
EV = ($6,000) - ($7,000)
EV = $6,000 - $7,000 = -$1,000

EV = (probability of win × payout) - (probability of loss × bet amount)

1. **Probability of winning**: 40% or 0.4
2. **Payout**: At 3:1 odds, if you bet $1, you win $3 (plus your original bet back), so the total return is $4 for a $1 bet. For a bet amount \( x \), the payout would be \( 3x \).
3. **Probability of losing**: 60% or 0.6
4. **Bet amount**: \( x \)

Now, substituting these values into the EV formula:

EV = (0.4 × 3x) - (0.6 × x)

1,"You can bet on a coin flip where you win $2.1 for every $1 you bet if heads, but lose $1 if tails. You have $10,000. How much should you bet?",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg,"Let initial wealth \( W = \$10,000 \).  
Let bet amount \( x \).  
Coin flip outcomes:  
- Heads (probability 0.5): win \( 2.1x \), wealth becomes \( 10,000 + 2.1x \).
- Tails (probability 0.5): lose \( x \), wealth becomes \( 10,000 - x \).  

Utility function: \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \).

**Expected utility:**
\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \cdot U(10,000 + 2.1x) + 0.5 \cdot U(10,000 - x)

\[
(10,000 - x)^2 = 100,000,000 - 20,000x + x^2

So,
\[
EU(x) = \frac{1}{4} \left[200,000,000 + 22,000x + 5.41x^2\right]

**Maximize EU(x):**

Take derivative w.r.t. \( x \), set to 0:
\[

\[
22,000 + 10.82x = 0

\[
x = \frac{-22,000}{10.82} \approx -2,033.28

But negative \( x \) means ""betting"" negative amount, i.e., betting on tails, which is not the value-maximizing direction given the bet pays more for heads. However, the expected utility is maximized at taking the **maximum possible bet in the positive direction** (betting on heads).

Alternatively, check endpoint:
- If \( x \rightarrow \infty \), both possible wealth outcomes increase without bound (since \( U(W) \) is convex and grows with \( W^2 \)).
- The expected utility is maximized by betting as much as possible and more, including leverage.

**Conclusion:**  
With this utility function (\( U(W) = W^2/2 \)), the optimal bet is to bet as much as possible, including borrowing or leveraging to the highest possible amount. With no constraints, the theoretically optimal choice is to bet an infinite amount. If limited to only own wealth (\$10,000), bet the full \$10,000. If leverage is allowed, borrow and bet as much as possible. The positive expected value and the convex utility function mean that the more you bet, the higher your expected utility."

This is a negative number, which means the expected utility is maximized at \(x = 0\), i.e., not investing.

**However, with quadratic utility, higher variance can be preferred if the quadratic coefficient is negative.**

But here, since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive (4981), and the linear coefficient (18W₀) is positive, the function increases as \(x\) increases.

So the expected utility increases without bound as \(x\) increases, i.e., the optimal choice is to invest as much as possible, including borrowing/leverage, since each extra dollar invested increases expected utility.

**Conclusion:**  
Invest as much as possible, including using leverage if available, to maximize returns in this extremely high-variance, high-reward scenario. The optimal amount is not limited by current wealth; the higher the investment (even with borrowing), the greater the expected utility under this utility function."

(5,000 + 1.5x)^2 + (5,000 - x)^2 = 50,000,000 + 5,000x + 3.25x^2
$$

So,
$$
EU(x) = \frac{1}{4} (50,000,000 + 5,000x + 3.25x^2)
$$

Maximize with respect to $x$:
Take derivative and set to zero:
$$
\frac{d}{dx} EU(x) = \frac{1}{4} (5,000 + 2 \times 3.25x) = 0
$$
$$
5,000 + 6.5x = 0 \implies x = -\frac{5,000}{6.5} \approx -769.23
$$

This is a minimum (since coefficient of $x^2$ is positive), so the expected utility increases as $x$ increases without bound.

**Constraint:**  
- Maximum possible bet = all available wealth (can also consider borrowing/leverage).
- If allowed unlimited borrowing/leverage, optimal bet is infinite.

**Conclusion:**  
With this utility function, the optimal choice is to bet as much as possible (including using all available wealth and any borrowing/leverage), because expected utility always increases with larger bets. The highest possible bet (including leveraging beyond existing wealth) yields the highest expected utility. If limited to betting your own funds, bet $5,000. If borrowing is allowed, bet the maximum possible."
7,"You can invest in a stock that has a 30% chance of doubling and a 70% chance of losing half its value. You have $20,000 to invest. How much should you invest?",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg,"Let \( W_0 = \$20,000 \).

**Investment outcomes if investing \( x \) dollars (allowing leverage or borrowing):**
- 30% chance: investment becomes \( x \times 2 \)  
- 70% chance: investment becomes \( x \times 0.5 \)

Final wealth in each outcome:
- If stock doubles: \( W_{up} = W_0 - x + 2x = W_0 + x \)
- If stock loses half: \( W_{down} = W_0 - x + 0.5x = W_0 - 0.5x \)

**CRRA utility function \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \):**

- Expected utility:  
\( EU = 0.3 \times \frac{(W_0 + x)^2}{2} + 0.7 \times \frac{(W_0 - 0.5x)^2}{2} \)

Expand:
\[
EU = 0.3 \times \frac{(W_0 + x)^2}{2} + 0.7 \times \frac{(W_0 - 0.5x)^2}{2}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.3}{2}(W_0^2 + 2W_0x + x^2) + \frac{0.7}{2}(W_0^2 - W_0x + 0.25x^2)
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} [0.3W_0^2 + 0.6W_0x + 0.3x^2 + 0.7W_0^2 - 0.7W_0x + 0.175x^2]
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} [W_0^2 - 0.1W_0x + 0.475x^2]
\]

**Maximize expected utility:**

Derivative w.r.t \( x \), set to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx} EU = \frac{1}{2}(-0.1W_0 + 2 \times 0.475x) = 0
\]
\[
-0.1W_0 + 0.95x = 0
\]
\[
x = \frac{0.1}{0.95} W_0 \approx 0.10526 W_0
\]

Plug in \( W_0 = \$20,000 \):
\[
x = 0.10526 \times 20,000 = \$2,105.26
\]

---

**Optimal investment:**  
Invest **$2,105.26** in the stock (about 10.5% of available wealth). The rest should be kept in cash. This maximizes expected utility based on the given probabilities and CRRA utility function."
8,"A company offers you two job options: Option A pays $80,000 guaranteed, Option B pays $40,000 plus a 20% chance of $400,000 bonus. Which should you choose?",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg,"Let’s compare the two options using expected value:

### Option A:
- Guaranteed $80,000

### Option B:
- Base: $40,000  
- Bonus: 20% chance of $400,000  
- Total in bonus case: $40,000 + $400,000 = $440,000  
- 80% chance of just $40,000

**Expected value for Option B:**  
= (20% × $440,000) + (80% × $40,000)  
= (0.2 × $440,000) + (0.8 × $40,000)  
= $88,000 + $32,000  
= $120,000

### Comparison:
- Option A: $80,000  
- Option B: $120,000

**Conclusion:**  
Option B has a higher expected value ($120,000 vs. $80,000). Choose Option B for the best outcome based on maximizing expected returns."
9,"You can bet on a sports team with 3:1 odds. You think they have a 40% chance of winning. You have $2,000. How much should you bet?",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg,"**Assumptions:**
- Wealth: $2,000
- Bet amount: $x
- Probability of win: 0.4 (win), 0.6 (lose)
- Odds: 3:1 (bet $x$, win $3x$ profit + original $x$ back = $4x$ total; lose, get $0$ back)
- Utility function: \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \)

**Possible outcomes:**
- If win: Final wealth = $2,000 + 3x$
- If lose: Final wealth = $2,000 - x$

**Expected utility:**
\[
EU = 0.4 \times \frac{(2000 + 3x)^2}{2} + 0.6 \times \frac{(2000 - x)^2}{2}
\]

**Expand:**
\[
EU = 0.4 \times \frac{(2000 + 3x)^2}{2} + 0.6 \times \frac{(2000 - x)^2}{2}
\]
\[
= 0.2 \times (2000 + 3x)^2 + 0.3 \times (2000 - x)^2
\]
\[
= 0.2 \times (4,000,000 + 12,000x + 9x^2) + 0.3 \times (4,000,000 - 4,000x + x^2)
\]
\[
= 800,000 + 2,400x + 1.8x^2 + 1,200,000 - 1,200x + 0.3x^2
\]
\[
= (800,000 + 1,200,000) + (2,400x - 1,200x) + (1.8x^2 + 0.3x^2)
\]
\[
= 2,000,000 + 1,200x + 2.1x^2
\]

**Maximize Expected Utility:**
Take derivative with respect to \( x \):

\[
\frac{d}{dx} EU = 1,200 + 4.2x
\]

Set derivative to zero:
\[
1,200 + 4.2x = 0 \implies x = -\frac{1,200}{4.2} \approx -285.71
\]

But this is negative, which is not possible for a bet amount (can't bet negative). So, expected utility increases as \( x \) increases.

Check at maximum possible bet. Since the utility function is convex, more risk increases expected utility. There is no upper bound specified for betting (assuming borrowing is allowed or leverage is available).

**If unlimited leverage is allowed:**
The larger the bet, the higher the expected utility. The function is strictly increasing in \( x \). The optimal strategy is to bet as much as possible.

**If only own funds ($2,000) can be bet:**
Bet $2,000.

**Conclusion:**

**Optimal bet is $2,000** (all available wealth). If borrowing is available with no limits, bet as much as possible, since expected utility increases with the size of the bet. This result is due to the quadratic (convex) utility function, which rewards larger risk."
10,"You're playing poker and have pocket tens (the fifth best starting hand). The pot is $500, and your opponent goes all-in for $5,000. You estimate you have a 45% chance of winning. You have $20,000 in chips. Should you call?",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg,"Let’s calculate the expected value (EV) of calling the $5,000 all-in:

**Key numbers:**
- Current pot: $500
- Call amount: $5,000
- Your stack before call: $20,000
- Opponent’s stack: $5,000 (assume they’re all-in)
- Win probability: 45%
- Lose probability: 55%

**Possible outcomes:**
1. **Win:**  
   - You gain the entire pot: $500 (pot) + $5,000 (opponent’s bet) = $5,500  
   - Your ending stack: $20,000 - $5,000 (your call) + $5,500 (pot) = $20,500

2. **Lose:**  
   - You lose your call: -$5,000  
   - Your ending stack: $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000

**Expected Value Calculation:**

EV = (Probability of Winning × Amount Won) + (Probability of Losing × Amount Lost)

EV = (0.45 × $5,500) + (0.55 × -$5,000)  
EV = ($2,475) + (-$2,750)  
EV = -$275

**Conclusion:**  
Calling the $5,000 all-in with a 45% chance of winning leads to a negative expected value of -$275. The optimal decision is to fold, because calling loses money on average."
