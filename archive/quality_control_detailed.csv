risk-averse,1,You have $1000. You have an option to put on any amount of money on a 51/49 coin flip. How much are you investing?,"Let initial wealth \( W_0 = \$1000 \).
Bet amount \( b \), \( 0 \leq b \leq 1000 \).  
If heads (probability 0.51): win, wealth is \( W_H = W_0 + b \)  
If tails (probability 0.49): lose, wealth is \( W_T = W_0 - b \)  

Apply utility: \( U(W) = -1/W \)  
Expected utility for given \( b \):  
\[
EU(b) = 0.51 \times \left( -\frac{1}{1000 + b} \right) + 0.49 \times \left( -\frac{1}{1000 - b} \right)
\]

Let’s check expected utility at a few bets:

**No bet (\(b = 0\)):**
\[
EU(0) = 0.51 \left(-\frac{1}{1000}\right) + 0.49 \left(-\frac{1}{1000}\right) = -\frac{1}{1000}
\]

**$50 bet (\(b = 50\)):**
\[
EU(50) = 0.51 \left(-\frac{1}{1050}\right) + 0.49 \left(-\frac{1}{950}\right)
\]
\[
= 0.51*(-0.0009524) + 0.49*(-0.0010526) = -0.0004857 -0.0005168 = -0.0010025
\]

**$100 bet:**
\[
EU(100) = 0.51 \left(-\frac{1}{1100}\right) + 0.49\left(-\frac{1}{900}\right)
\]
\[
= 0.51*(-0.0009091) + 0.49*(-0.0011111) = -0.0004636 -0.0005444 = -0.001008
\]

**$200 bet:**
\[
EU(200) = 0.51 \left(-\frac{1}{1200}\right) + 0.49\left(-\frac{1}{800}\right)
\]
\[
= 0.51*(-0.0008333) + 0.49*(-0.00125) = -0.0004250 -0.0006125 = -0.0010375
\]

**$400 bet:**
\[
EU(400) = 0.51 \left(-\frac{1}{1400}\right) + 0.49\left(-\frac{1}{600}\right)
\]
\[
= 0.51*(-0.0007143) + 0.49*(-0.0016667) = -0.0003643 -0.0008167 = -0.001181
\]

Comparing values (closer to zero is better, since utility is negative):  
- No bet: -0.001000  
- $50:    -0.0010025  
- $100:   -0.001008  
- $200:   -0.0010375  
- $400:   -0.001181  

The option with the least-negative (highest) expected utility is betting **nothing**.

**Conclusion:**  
With a starting wealth of $1000, the optimal choice is to place **no bet** on the 51/49 coin flip. Betting any amount reduces the expected value according to the given utility function.",risk-averse,85.0,85.0,10.0

The correlation between the 2 securities is 0.5. You have a cap on investment of $1M gross, how much do you invest in each securities?","Let’s assume total starting wealth \(W_0 = \$1,000,000\). The investment cap is $1,000,000 gross, so the sum of the absolute values of allocations to A and B cannot exceed $1,000,000. Short positions are not specified, so assume only non-negative allocations (long only).

Let \(x_A\) and \(x_B\) be the dollar amounts invested in A and B, with \(x_A + x_B \leq \$1,000,000\), \(x_A, x_B \geq 0\).

\]

Let’s analyze allocations with $1,000,000 split in different proportions:

#### Case 1: 100% A ($1,000,000$ A, $0$ B)
- Mean = 5%, Std = 20%
- \(W_1 = 1,000,000 \times (1 + r)\), with \(r \sim N(5\%, 20\%)\)

#### Case 2: 100% B ($0$ A, $1,000,000$ B)
- Mean = 3%, Std = 15%
- \(W_1 = 1,000,000 \times (1 + r)\), with \(r \sim N(3\%, 15\%)\)

#### Case 3: 50% A, 50% B ($500,000$ each)
\[
{\rm Mean} = 0.5 \times 5\% + 0.5 \times 3\% = 4\%
\]
\[
{\rm Stdev}^2 = 0.5^2 \times (0.20)^2 + 0.5^2 \times (0.15)^2 + 2 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.20 \times 0.15 = 0.010 + 0.005625 + 0.0075 = 0.023125
\]
\[
{\rm Stdev} = \sqrt{0.023125} \approx 15.2\%
\]

#### Case 4: 70% A, 30% B ($700,000$ A, $300,000$ B)
\[
{\rm Mean} = 0.7 \times 5\% + 0.3 \times 3\% = 4.4\%
\]
\[
{\rm Stdev}^2 = 0.7^2 \times (0.20)^2 + 0.3^2 \times (0.15)^2 + 2 \times 0.7 \times 0.3 \times 0.5 \times 0.20 \times 0.15
\]
\[
= 0.49 \times 0.04 + 0.09 \times 0.0225 + 0.21 \times 0.015
= 0.0196 + 0.002025 + 0.00315
= 0.024775
\]
\[
{\rm Stdev} = \sqrt{0.024775} \approx 15.75\%
\]

#### Case 5: 30% A, 70% B ($300,000$ A, $700,000$ B)
\[
{\rm Mean} = 0.3 \times 5\% + 0.7 \times 3\% = 3.6\%
\]
\[
{\rm Stdev}^2 = 0.3^2 \times 0.04 + 0.7^2 \times 0.0225 + 2 \times 0.3 \times 0.7 \times 0.5 \times 0.20 \times 0.15
\]
\[
= 0.09 \times 0.04 + 0.49 \times 0.0225 + 0.21 \times 0.015

= 0.017775
\]
\[
{\rm Stdev} = \sqrt{0.017775} \approx 13.34\%
\]

### Expected Utility Calculation

For each scenario, simulate end wealth distributions, apply \(U(W) = - 1 / W\), and compute the average.

For simplicity (since distribution is approximately normal), use a 2-point approximation at:

- Mean + 1 stdev (prob ≈ 16%)
- Mean - 1 stdev (prob ≈ 16%)
- Mean (prob ≈ 68%)

#### Case 3 Example (50/50 Split):

Mean return: 4%, Stdev: 15.2%
Output scenarios:
- Best case: \(1M \times (1 + 0.04 + 0.152) = \$1,192,000\) (16%)
- Worst case: \(1M \times (1 + 0.04 - 0.152) = \$888,000\) (16%)
- Middle case: \(1M \times 1.04 = \$1,040,000\) (68%)

Apply utility:
- Best: \(-1 / 1,192,000 = -8.39 \times 10^{-7}\)
- Worst: \(-1 / 888,000 = -1.126 \times 10^{-6}\)
- Middle: \(-1 / 1,040,000 = -9.62 \times 10^{-7}\)

Expected utility:
\(EU = 0.16(-8.39e-7) + 0.16(-1.126e-6) + 0.68(-9.62e-7) = -9.90 \times 10^{-7}\)

#### Compare All Cases

Do the same for other splits:

**Case 1 (100% A):**
- Mean: 5%, Stdev: 20%
- Best: \(1M \times 1.25 = \$1,250,000\)
- Worst: \(1M \times 0.85 = \$850,000\)
- Middle: \(1M \times 1.05 = \$1,050,000\)
- Utilities: -8e-7, -1.176e-6, -9.52e-7
- EU: -1.003e-6

**Case 2 (100% B):**
- Mean: 3%, Stdev: 15%
- Best: \(1M \times 1.18 = \$1,180,000\)
- Worst: \(1M \times 0.88 = \$880,000\)
- Middle: \(1M \times 1.03 = \$1,030,000\)
- Utilities: -8.47e-7, -1.136e-6, -9.71e-7
- EU: -9.93e-7

**Case 4 (70% A / 30% B):**
- Mean: 4.4%, Stdev: 15.75%
- Best: \(1M \times 1.196 = \$1,196,000\)
- Worst: \(1M \times 0.932 = \$932,000\)
- Middle: \(1M \times 1.044 = \$1,044,000\)
- Utilities: -8.36e-7, -1.073e-6, -9.58e-7
- EU: -9.86e-7

**Case 5 (30% A / 70% B):**
- Mean: 3.6%, Stdev: 13.3%
- Best: \(1M \times 1.169 = \$1,169,000\)
- Worst: \(1M \times 0.903 = \$903,000\)
- Middle: \(1M \times 1.036 = \$1,036,000\)
- Utilities: -8.56e-7, -1.107e-6, -9.65e-7
- EU: -9.92e-7

### **Comparison (Smaller is Better):**

- 50/50 split: -9.90e-7 (best, highest expected utility)
- 70/30 split: -9.86e-7 (slightly better)
- 100% B: -9.93e-7
- 30/70 split: -9.92e-7
- 100% A: -1.00e-6 (worst, lowest expected utility)

### **Optimal Allocation**

Invest approximately **$700,000 in Security A and $300,000 in Security B**. This split delivers the best expected outcome for $1 million invested, balancing downside risk and upside potential according to the given utility function.",risk-averse,75.0,78.0,20.0
risk-averse,3,"There are 2 securities, A and B, where A has a expected return of 5% and a vol of 100%, securities B which has a expected return of 1% and a vol of 1%. The 2 securities are uncorrelated. You have a total portfolio vol limit of 1M. How much should you invest in each securities?","Assumptions:  
- Total initial wealth = $10,000,000  
- Volatility = standard deviation of returns  
- You can use leverage or short selling if optimal

**Step 1: Let \( x_A \) and \( x_B \) be dollar allocations to A and B.**

\[
\text{Total volatility} = \sqrt{(x_A \cdot 100\%)^2 + (x_B \cdot 1\%)^2}
\]
Set the volatility to your limit:
\[
\sqrt{(x_A \cdot 1.0)^2 + (x_B \cdot 0.01)^2} = 1,000,000
\]
\[
(x_A)^2 + (x_B \cdot 0.01)^2 = (1,000,000)^2
\]
\[
(x_A)^2 + (0.0001)(x_B)^2 = 1 \times 10^{12}
\]

**Step 2: Expected wealth outcomes**
Assume the securities’ returns are normally distributed over a one-year horizon.

- Security A: +5% or -95% (for illustration; uses ±1 std deviation)
- Security B: +1% or 0% (±1 std deviation is basically negligibly different from mean due to low vol)

Let's check a few allocations. Put most risk into the lower volatility security to avoid serious negative tails for a CRRA = 2 utility.

### **Case 1: 100% in B**

\( x_B = 100\% \) of $10,000,000 = $10,000,000  
Since B has low volatility (\( \sigma_B = 1\% \)), $10,000,000 × 1\% = $100,000$, far less than the $1,000,000$ risk limit.

So,  
\[
x_B = \frac{1,000,000}{0.01} = \$100,000,000
\]  
But only $10,000,000$ capital, so lever up 10× to hit risk limit.

Return scenarios:  
- **Best**: $100M × 1.01 = $101,000,000  
- **Worst**: $100M × 0.99 = $99,000,000  
Probability: assume normal, but with vol so low, distribution is very tight.

- Probability-weighted utility: close to that of wealth always ≈ $100,000,000

### **Case 2: 100% in A (hit risk limit)**

\( x_A = \frac{\text{Vol limit}}{Vol} = \frac{1,000,000}{1.0} = \$1,000,000 \)

Use only $1,000,000$ capital; rest is uninvested.

Return scenarios:  
- **+1σ**: 1M × 2.05 = $2,050,000$ (gain 105%)   
- **-1σ**: 1M × 0.05 = $50,000$ (loss 95%)  
Uninvested capital: $9,000,000$, so total final wealth: $9,000,000$ + above scenarios.

- **Best:** $9,000,000 + 2,050,000 = $11,050,000$
- **Worst:** $9,000,000 + 50,000 = $9,050,000$

Probability-weighted utility: worse than 100% in B, because bad outcome is much lower.

### **Case 3: Combine A & B**

Let’s put the minimum in A to hit risk limit, rest in B.  
Let \( x_A = y \), \( x_B = z \).  
Constraint: \( y^2 + 0.0001 z^2 = 1 \times 10^{12} \)

Try \( y = 0 \): \( z = 1,000,000/0.01 = $100,000,000 \) (as above).

Try \( y = 1,000,000 \): \( (1,000,000)^2 + 0.0001 z^2 = 1 \times 10^{12} \Rightarrow z = 0 \).  
This is the pure A scenario.

Try small \( y \): let’s do \( y = 200,000 \):

\[
(200,000)^2 + 0.0001 z^2 = 1 \times 10^{12}
\rightarrow 4 \times 10^{10} + 0.0001 z^2 = 1 \times 10^{12}
\rightarrow 0.0001 z^2 = 9.6 \times 10^{11}
\rightarrow z^2 = 9.6 \times 10^{15}
\rightarrow z = 98,000,000
\]  
(rounded)

Total investment: $200,000 + $98,000,000 = $98,200,000 (levered position).

Wealth scenarios:  
- A: +105%: $200,000 × 2.05 = $410,000, -95%: $200,000 × 0.05 = $10,000  
- B: ±1%: $98,000,000 × 1.01 = $98,980,000, × 0.99 = $97,020,000  

- Best case: $98,980,000 + $410,000 = $99,390,000  
- Worst case: $97,020,000 + $10,000 = $97,030,000

Range: $99.39M$ down to $97.03M$

This is still much less downside risk than pure A.

**Expected utility:**
Given utility is highly concave, outcomes with deep downside (A) are much less attractive than very high-probability, tight range outcomes (B).

### **Conclusion (Optimal Allocation)**

- Allocate **$0 to A** and **$100,000,000 to B** (using 10× leverage).  
- This allocation puts portfolio volatility at the $1,000,000 limit, with extremely minimal downside risk.
- Allocating to A increases possible losses, which is penalized severely by the utility function.

**Key numbers:**  
- 100% (levered) to B gives final wealth tightly around $100,000,000.  
- Any significant allocation to A brings much more downside, with minimal expected return gain, which is strongly disfavored by the U(W) = -1/W utility.

**Optimal Choice:**  
Invest **$100,000,000** (10× leverage) in Security B and **$0** in Security A to maximize expected utility under these parameters.",risk-averse,85.0,75.0,20.0

Otherwise, you pay 100K per  year in premium. You do feel a large amount of disutility when your house get destroy however, both emotionally, and because the house is 100% of your net worth. Should you get this insurance?","Assumptions:

- Current net worth (house value): $1,000,000
- Annual insurance premium: $100,000
- Probability of house being destroyed: 5% (0.05)
- Payout if destroyed: $1,000,000 (replaces the house)
- Without insurance, loss if destroyed: house goes to $0

### Strategy 1: **Buy Insurance**
- If house is NOT destroyed (95%): wealth = $1,000,000 − $100,000 = $900,000
- If house is destroyed (5%): payout covers house, net wealth = $1,000,000 − $100,000 = $900,000

### Strategy 2: **Do NOT Buy Insurance**
- If house is NOT destroyed (95%): wealth = $1,000,000
- If house is destroyed (5%): wealth = $0

Expected utility:
\[

---

### Comparison

- With insurance, possible wealth is $900,000.
- Without insurance, there is a 5% chance wealth is $0.

**Conclusion:**  
Buy the insurance. The catastrophic loss of the house (losing everything) has so much negative impact that avoiding a 5% chance of losing $1,000,000 is worth the $100,000 premium; the guaranteed $900,000 outcome is strictly better given the very large penalty imposed by the \( U(W) \) function for zero wealth.",risk-averse,85.0,75.0,20.0

Your only option is to invest this in an index fund, which historically return 5% real returns per year, but does carry large drawdown. How much should you invest?

- Starting wealth: $50,000  
- Option: Invest all, none, or part in index fund  
- Index fund returns:

  (Assumed for illustration; actual risk/return distributions are more complex, but this is typical for analysis.)

Let x = amount invested in index fund  
Uninvested cash ($50,000 – x) is assumed risk-free (no gain/loss).

- Up: $(50,000 – x) + 1.2x$ = $50,000 + 0.2x$  
- Down: $(50,000 – x) + 0.8x$ = $50,000 – 0.2x$

### 1. Zero risk: x = 0 (no investment)
- Both outcomes: $50,000  
E[U] = –1/50,000 = –0.00002  

### 2. Partial: x = $10,000 (20%)
- Up: $50,000 + $2,000 = $52,000  
- Down: $50,000 – $2,000 = $48,000  
E[U] = 0.5 × [–1/52,000] + 0.5 × [–1/48,000]

### **Conclusion**
The expected utility is maximized by keeping almost all wealth in cash and investing only a small amount in the index fund. The more invested, the *lower* the expected utility due to CRRA risk aversion (γ = 2), even with attractive expected returns. Investing $0 results in highest expected utility, but $10,000 (20%) is nearly identical and has only a minimal decrease.

**Optimal choice:**  
Investing 0–$10,000 (0–20%) in the index fund achieves the best balance between risk and return given the current wealth and utility function. The rest stays risk-free. This minimizes the potential negative utility from losses. Most of the $50,000 should be kept in cash, with up to $10,000 invested if seeking some exposure for potential upside.",risk-averse,85.0,85.0,20.0
risk-averse,6,"You are a retiree, having £500K left in your retirement saving. Your only investmnet option other than holding it in cash is to invest this in an index fund, which historically return 5% real returns per year, but does carry large drawdown. Your yearly minimum spending is around 50K a year. Your life expectancy is 10 year left. How much should you invest? ","Let’s define:

- Wealth now: £500,000  
- Safe (cash) return: 0% real  
- Index fund: 5% expected real return per year, but not riskless  
- Minimum spending: £50,000 per year for 10 years (total £500,000 needed)  
- Utility: \( U(W) = -\frac{1}{W} \), CRRA with risk aversion coefficient 2  
- Goal: Choose how much to put in index fund (rest in cash) to maximize expected utility

### Simplifying assumptions
To keep calculations clear:
- “Investment” happens once at the start; withdrawals for spending are made at year-end each year.
- The index fund has a 5% expected real return per year, but introduces risk.
- We’ll model the fund returns as either +25% over 10 years (good outcome, ~2.25% p.a.), or -25% over 10 years (~-2.8% p.a.), each with 50% probability. This reflects risk of loss over a decade.

### Calculating wealth at end of 10 years for different allocations

Let \( x \) be the amount invested in index fund.
Then £500K – x is held safely.

#### Scenario 1: All in Cash (\( x = 0 \))
Each year, withdraw £50K. After 10 years, £500K – £500K = £0.  
\( W = £0 \) (ruin).

#### Scenario 2: All in Index Fund (\( x = 500,000 \))
- Good outcome (50%): \( 500,000 \times 1.25 = £625,000 \) after 10 years
- Bad outcome (50%): \( 500,000 \times 0.75 = £375,000 \)  
Either way, £500K total spending over 10 years is needed.

But wealth path matters; but for simplicity, let’s assume withdrawals are possible as long as wealth covers them. Most risk is of ruin in the bad outcome.

Actually, with £50K spending per year, even in the bad outcome (£375K after a 25% fall), you will run out before 10 years. Let’s be more precise: simulate the year-by-year process below for a couple of middling allocations.

---

## Key allocations:  
Try 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% in index fund.

Let’s compute using an approximate method:
- Compound the invested portion for 10 years (in each scenario).
- Subtract £50K × 10 = £500K from total.

But ruin is possible: at some allocations, the funds may run out before 10 years. Let’s look for allocations that minimize this.

### Calculation Table

#### 0% Index Fund
- Cash: £500K. Each year, withdraw £50K. At end of year 10: £0 (run out exactly).

#### 20% Index Fund (£100K in index fund, £400K in cash)
- Index Fund after 10 years: Good: £100K × 1.25 = £125K;  Bad: £100K × 0.75 = £75K
- Cash: £400K
- Total after 10 years: £525K (good)/£475K (bad)
- Withdrawals: £500K over 10 years
- Good: £25K left after 10 years
- Bad: –£25K (run out, but only just at the end)

#### 40% Index Fund (£200K index, £300K cash)
- Index after 10 yrs: Good: £250K, Bad: £150K
- Total: £550K (good), £450K (bad)
- Withdrawals: £500K
- Good: £50K left; Bad: (£50K), run out before 10 yrs

#### 60% Index Fund (£300K, £200K cash)
- Index after 10: £375K (good), £225K (bad)
- Total: £575K (good), £425K (bad)
- Withdrawals: £500K
- Good: £75K left; Bad: (£75K), run out sooner

#### 80% Index Fund (£400K, £100K cash)
- Index: £500K (good), £300K (bad)
- Total: £600K (good), £400K (bad)
- Withdrawals: £500K
- Good: £100K left; Bad: (£100K), run out earlier

#### 100% Index Fund (£500K, £0 cash)
- Index: £625K (good), £375K (bad)
- Total: £625K (good), £375K (bad)
- Withdrawals: £500K
- Good: £125K left; Bad: (£125K), run out even earlier

### Expected utility
The utility is highly negative as wealth approaches zero, and infinite penalty for going negative (assuming can't spend more than is available). So allocations that run out before 10 years give extremely poor expected utility.

**The best allocation avoids running out of money in the ""bad"" (–25%) case.**  
Looking above, with 20% in index fund:  
- In bad case, wealth is just barely negative (runs out right at the end).  
- With 0% in the fund, you run out exactly at the end, but no extra in a good case.  
- With 40%+, you run out before year 10 in the bad case.

### **Final Answer**

**Invest £100,000 (20%) in the index fund and keep £400,000 in cash.**  
This avoids running out of money in the bad scenario and gives room for upside in the good scenario. Both 0% and 20% keep the worst-case risk identical (no ruin before 10 years), but the 20% allocation gives higher expected value if things go well without increasing the risk of running out. Larger allocations increase risk of ruin before 10 years.

**Key numbers:**  
- 20% allocation: in the bad case, you barely make it through 10 years; in the good case, more is left over.  
- Any higher allocation increases risk of running out before 10 years in the bad scenario.  
- Any lower allocation gives no upside if the fund performs well.",risk-averse,85.0,85.0,20.0

risk-averse,13,"You're offered a lottery ticket for $1 that has a 1 in 10,000 chance of winning $5,000. You have $100 in cash. How many tickets should you buy?","Let  
- Initial wealth \(W_0 = \$100\)  
- Ticket cost = \$1  
- Probability of winning per ticket = \(1/10,000\)  
- Prize = \$5,000

Let's consider buying \(n\) tickets, where \(n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10\) (buying many more will quickly become suboptimal due to risk aversion).

### For each value of \(n\), calculate expected utility:

#### Wealth Outcomes
- If at least one ticket wins: final wealth \(= 100 - n + 5,000 = 5,100 - n\)
- If no ticket wins: final wealth \(= 100 - n\)

#### Probabilities
- Chance at least one ticket wins: \(p_{\text{win}} = 1 - (1 - 1/10,000)^n\)
- Chance no ticket wins: \(p_{\text{loss}} = (1 - 1/10,000)^n\)

#### Utility Calculation
Utility for wealth \(W\): \(U(W) = -1/W\)

Expected utility:
\[
EU(n) = p_{\text{win}} \times U(5,100 - n) + p_{\text{loss}} \times U(100 - n)

Let's compute for small \(n\):

---

#### **n = 0**
- \(p_{\text{win}} = 0\)
- \(p_{\text{loss}} = 1\)
- \(EU(0) = -1/100\)

#### **n = 1**
- \(p_{\text{win}} = 1 - (1 - 1/10,000)^1 \approx 0.0001\)
- \(p_{\text{loss}} \approx 0.9999\)
- \(U(5,099) = -1/5,099 \approx -0.000196\)
- \(U(99) = -1/99 \approx -0.010101\)
- \(EU(1) \approx 0.0001 \times (-0.000196) + 0.9999 \times (-0.010101) \approx -0.010100\)

#### **n = 2**
- \(p_{\text{win}} = 1 - (1 - 1/10,000)^2 \approx 0.00019999\)
- \(p_{\text{loss}} \approx 0.99980001\)
- \(U(5,098) = -1/5,098 \approx -0.000196\)
- \(U(98) = -1/98 \approx -0.010204\)
- \(EU(2) \approx 0.00019999 \times (-0.000196) + 0.99980 \times (-0.010204) \approx -0.010202\)

#### **n = 3**

- \(p_{\text{loss}} \approx 0.99970003\)
- \(U(5,097) = -1/5,097 \approx -0.000196\)
- \(U(97) = -1/97 \approx -0.010309\)

\end{align*}
\]

The expected utility decreases as \(n\) increases.

### **Conclusion**
Buying **zero tickets** is optimal. With this risk aversion, even a small bet size leads to lower expected utility compared to not playing. The key numbers are the very low probability of winning and the steep decrease in utility for reduced wealth due to high risk aversion.

## Conclusion
The maximum expected utility is at \( x = \$0M \).

## Conclusion

The expected utility is maximized by investing **nothing**. Even very small bets slightly reduce expected utility due to the high chance of permanent loss of capital. Betting any positive amount slightly increases potential gain, but the large probability of loss and the highly risk-averse utility function (CRRA, coefficient 2) means no investment is optimal. 

**Optimal choice: Invest \$0.**  
With \$10,000, keeping all funds in cash is preferred given the 99% chance of losing any amount invested and a very strong penalty for losses.",risk-averse,85.0,78.0,20.0
risk-averse,18,"You're offered insurance on your $500,000 house. There's a 0.1% chance per year of total loss, and the premium is $2,000 per year. The insurance company's expected payout is $500 per year, but they charge $2,000. Should you buy this insurance?","Let's calculate expected utility with and without insurance using \( U(W) = -\frac{1}{W} \), initial wealth \( W_0 = \$500{,}000 \).

**With Insurance ($2,000 premium):**
- Wealth after premium (no matter what): \( 500,000 - 2,000 = 498,000 \)
- Utility: \( U_1 = -\frac{1}{498,000} \)

**Without Insurance:**
- 99.9% chance: No loss, keep \$500,000
    - Utility: \( U_{NL} = -\frac{1}{500,000} \)
- 0.1% chance: Lose \$500,000, wealth = \$0
    - Utility: \( U_{L} = -\infty \)
- Expected utility: \( 0.999 \times U_{NL} + 0.001 \times U_{L} \)

However, \( U_{L} = -\infty \), so expected utility without insurance is dominated by even this tiny probability of ruin.

**Conclusion:**  
Buying the insurance at a \$2,000 premium is optimal. The risk of losing everything (and reaching zero wealth) results in catastrophic expected utility loss. Paying \$2,000 eliminates this possibility and leads to a higher expected utility, despite the insurance being ""overpriced"" by expected value standards.

**Conclusion:**  
Betting nothing or a very small amount (like $250) produces the highest expected utility. Larger bets quickly reduce expected utility due to the high risk of losing a significant amount of wealth. The optimal choice is to bet $0 or, at most, $250, as this provides the best trade-off between risk and reward based on this utility function. The small chance of a large win is outweighed by the large chance of reducing wealth, so conservative betting is optimal.",risk-averse,75.0,75.0,20.0

The contract costs $200K to fulfill. You have $500K available. Should you take this contract?","Let's define outcomes for accepting the contract:

- **Initial wealth:** $500K
- **Contract cost:** $200K (paid up front)
- **Possible payment outcomes:**
  - $1,000,000 (p = 0.3)
  - $100,000 (p = 0.5)
  - $0         (p = 0.2)
- **Net wealth after contract:**  
  - Best case: $500K - $200K + $1,000K = $1,300K  
  - Mid case:  $500K - $200K + $100K = $400K  
  - Worst case: $500K - $200K + $0 = $300K  

Calculate expected utility for **taking** the contract:

\[
= 0.3 \times \left(-\frac{1}{1,300,000}\right) + 0.5 \times \left(-\frac{1}{400,000}\right) + 0.2 \times \left(-\frac{1}{300,000}\right)

**Conclusion:**  
With $500K in available funds, and under this utility function, do not take the contract.

Let \( x \) = proportion invested in A  
Let \( y \) = proportion invested in B  
Constraint: \( |x| + |y| \leq 1 \) (no leveraging beyond 100% of wealth)

### Key Calculations

#### Mean and variance of portfolio
Let
- \( \mu_A = 5\% \), \( \sigma_A = 20\% \)  
- \( \mu_B = 3\% \), \( \sigma_B = 15\% \)  
- \( \rho = 0.5 \)

Portfolio mean:  
\( E[r_p] = x\mu_A + y\mu_B \)

Variance:  
\( \sigma_p^2 = x^2\sigma_A^2 + y^2\sigma_B^2 + 2xy\rho\sigma_A\sigma_B \)

#### For log utility, the objective is approximately maximizing  
\( E[r_p] - \frac{1}{2}\sigma_p^2 \)

So,  
Objective:  
\( x\mu_A + y\mu_B - \frac{1}{2}(x^2\sigma_A^2 + y^2\sigma_B^2 + 2xy\rho\sigma_A\sigma_B) \)

Plug in numbers:  
\( x \cdot 0.05 + y \cdot 0.03 - \frac{1}{2} \left[ x^2 \cdot 0.04 + y^2 \cdot 0.0225 + 2xy \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 0.15 \right] \)  
\( = x \cdot 0.05 + y \cdot 0.03 - \frac{1}{2} (0.04x^2 + 0.0225y^2 + 0.03xy) \)

Simplifies to:  
\( 0.05x + 0.03y - 0.02x^2 - 0.01125y^2 - 0.015xy \)

#### Under the budget constraint \( x + y = 1 \), \( x,y \geq 0 \)
Solve for optimal allocation:

Let \( y = 1 - x \):

Plug in to objective:  
\( 0.05x + 0.03(1-x) - 0.02x^2 - 0.01125(1-x)^2 - 0.015x(1-x) \)

Expand and simplify:

\( = 0.05x + 0.03 - 0.03x - 0.02x^2 - 0.01125(1 - 2x + x^2) - 0.015x + 0.015x^2 \)

\( = 0.05x + 0.03 - 0.03x - 0.02x^2 - 0.01125 + 0.0225x - 0.01125x^2 - 0.015x + 0.015x^2 \)

Collect like terms:

- Constants: \( 0.03 - 0.01125 = 0.01875 \)
- x terms: \( 0.05x - 0.03x + 0.0225x - 0.015x = 0.0275x \)
- \( x^2 \) terms: \( -0.02x^2 - 0.01125x^2 + 0.015x^2 = -0.01625x^2 \)

So,

\( 0.01875 + 0.0275x - 0.01625x^2 \)

Maximize in \( x \) between 0 and 1.

The optimum is at:
\( x^* = \frac{0.0275}{2 \cdot 0.01625} = \frac{0.0275}{0.0325} \approx 0.846 \)

Since this is between 0 and 1, this is feasible.

So,

- Invest \( x^* \approx 84.6\% \) in Security A: $846,000  
- Invest \( 1 - x^* \approx 15.4\% \) in Security B: $154,000

### Conclusion

Invest \$846,000 in Security A (expected return 5%, volatility 20%) and \$154,000 in Security B (expected return 3%, volatility 15%). The higher allocation to A is driven by its higher expected return relative to risk, as well as the diversification benefit from the correlation.",log-utility,90.0,90.0,40.0

Given:
- \( \mu_A = 5\% \), \( \sigma_A = 100\% \)
- \( \mu_B = 1\% \), \( \sigma_B = 1\% \)
- Volatility constraint: portfolio standard deviation ≤ \( 1 \) (since $1M/$1M = fraction = 1)

Portfolio variance:  
\[
\sigma_p^2 = (x_A \sigma_A)^2 + (x_B \sigma_B)^2
\]
Since uncorrelated, no covariance term.

Constraint:  
\[
\sqrt{(x_A \cdot 1)^2 + (x_B \cdot 0.01)^2} \leq 1
\]

For log utility (coefficient 1), classic result:  
Optimal \( x_i = \frac{\mu_i - r_f}{\gamma \sigma_i^2} \) (if no risk-free, just maximize given constraint)

Full budget: \( x_A + x_B = 1 \)

But with log utility, maximize:  
\[
E[\ln(W_{\text{final}})] \approx \ln(W_0) + x_A \cdot \mu_A + x_B \cdot \mu_B - \frac{1}{2} (x_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + x_B^2 \sigma_B^2)
\]

Use Lagrange multipliers (subject to volatility constraint):
Let \( x_B \) absorb all low-risk allocation up to vol limit.

Try:
If invest entirely in B (\( x_A = 0, x_B = 1 \)),  
Portfolio vol = \( 1 \times 1\% = 1\% \ll 100\% \)—well within constraint.

If invest all in A (\( x_A = 1, x_B = 0 \)),  
Portfolio vol = \( 1 \times 100\% = 100\% \gg 1\% \)—exceeds constraint.

Let’s allocate as much as possible to A under the volatility cap. So set:
\[
\sqrt{(x_A \cdot 1)^2 + (x_B \cdot 0.01)^2} = 1
\]
But unless \( x_A \) is essentially 1, \( x_B \) contributes negligibly to vol.

So,
\[
x_A^2 \times 1^2 = 1 \implies x_A = 1
\]
That is, even 100% in A is at the limit.

Check: portfolio volatility = 100% of $1M = $1M (meets the max)

Expected dollar value in A: expected return is 5%, so $1M × 5% = $50,000 expected gain

In contrast, all in B ($1M): Expected return is 1%, so $10,000 expected gain. But risk is tiny, so with log utility, risk dominates only as risk gets very high compared to expected return.

The optimal allocation is:

- $1,000,000 in Security A
- $0 in Security B

Security A is used to its maximum allowed under the volatility constraint. Even 1% of wealth in Security B adds negligible return, given the volatility cap. The much higher expected return for A drives the decision.",log-utility,70.0,75.0,80.0

log-utility,10,"A friend at university, Sam, thinks that Ben can run 5KM in 20', given a week of training. You know Ben, who is quite unfit, and you know that this is a difficult thing to do because it take you quite a while to learn this. He offers you to buy this contract at 50% odd (where you sell), in up to $10K if you want. Your net worth is only 20K, however. What should you do? ","Let’s define:

- Probability that Ben succeeds, \( p \)  
- Bet: Sell a $10,000 contract to Sam at 50% odds  
- If Ben wins: pay Sam $10,000  
- If Ben loses: keep $10,000  
- Possible wealth: $30,000 (Ben loses) or $10,000 (Ben wins)  
- Current wealth: $20,000

Assume, based on your knowledge, Ben has only a 10% chance (\( p = 0.1 \)) of succeeding.

**Expected utility:**
\[
EU = p \ln(10{,}000) + (1-p) \ln(30{,}000)
\]
Plug in numbers:
- \(\ln(10{,}000) \approx 9.210\)
- \(\ln(30{,}000) \approx 10.31\)

\[
EU = 0.1 \times 9.210 + 0.9 \times 10.31 = 0.921 + 9.279 = 10.20
\]
Current utility (no bet):  
\(\ln(20{,}000) \approx 9.90\)

**Conclusion:**  
Selling Sam the maximum $10,000 contract increases final dollar amounts from $20,000 to either $30,000 or $10,000. With a low chance (10%) of Ben succeeding, the expectation favors taking the full $10,000 bet. The key driver is the very low likelihood of losing the $10,000 relative to the doubling in case of a win, compared to the current wealth level.

log-utility,13,"You're offered a lottery ticket for $1 that has a 1 in 10,000 chance of winning $5,000. You have $100 in cash. How many tickets should you buy?","Let \( W \) be current wealth: $100.

Let \( x \) be the number of tickets bought (\( 0 \leq x \leq 100 \)), each costing $1.

If one of your tickets wins, you receive $5,000 (plus whatever is left from $100 minus tickets bought). Since the odds are so small, assume negligible chance of multiple wins (buying 100 tickets in 10,000 possible).

The probability that at least one of \( x \) tickets wins is approximately:
\[
P(\text{win}) \approx 1 - (1 - \frac{1}{10{,}000})^{x} \approx \frac{x}{10{,}000}
\]
for small \( x \).

Wealth after buying \( x \) tickets and winning: \( 100 - x + 5{,}000 \).

Wealth if no win: \( 100 - x \).

Expected utility:
\[
EU(x) = P(\text{win}) \cdot \ln(100 - x + 5{,}000}) + (1 - P(\text{win})) \cdot \ln(100 - x)
\]
\[
= \frac{x}{10{,}000} \ln(5{,}100 - x) + \left(1 - \frac{x}{10{,}000}\right)\ln(100 - x)
\]

Find \( x \) that maximizes \( EU(x) \).

Check marginal benefit for one ticket:
\[
EU(1) \approx \frac{1}{10{,}000} \ln(5{,}099) + \frac{9{,}999}{10{,}000} \ln(99)
\]
\[
= 0.0001 \times 8.533 + 0.9999 \times 4.595
\]
\[
= 0.000853 + 4.5945 = 4.5954
\]

Compare to not buying:
\[
EU(0) = \ln(100) = 4.6052
\]

So, one ticket: 4.5954 < 4.6052. Utility decreases with even one ticket.

Test higher \( x \) (e.g., 10 tickets):

\[
EU(10) \approx \frac{10}{10{,}000} \ln(5{,}090) + \frac{9,990}{10{,}000} \ln(90)

- Final wealth: $5,000 (do nothing)

**If calling:**  
- Invest $1,000 to potentially win $1,100 (opponent's $1,000 + pot $100)
- If win (85%): Final wealth = $5,000 - $1,000 + $1,100 = $5,100  
- If lose (15%): Final wealth = $5,000 - $1,000 = $4,000

**Total wealth in each scenario** (assume starting wealth $0 for simplicity):

- $100M outcome: $30,000 salary + $100,000 equity = $130,000
- $0 outcome: $30,000 salary + $0 equity = $30,000

**Probabilities:**
- $1B: 5%

**Conclusion:**  
Optimal choice is to buy 7 weather derivatives for a total cost of $350. With this, if it rains, the gain is significant, while if not, the loss is manageable given the starting wealth.

risk-loving,1,You have $1000. You have an option to put on any amount of money on a 51/49 coin flip. How much are you investing?,"Let initial wealth be \( W_0 = \$1000 \).

Let bet amount be \( x \), where \( x \) can be any value (including leverage, so \( x > \$1000 \) is possible).

**Coin flip:**
- Win probability: 0.51, outcome: \( W_{\text{win}} = W_0 + x \)
- Lose probability: 0.49, outcome: \( W_{\text{lose}} = W_0 - x \)
- Utility function: \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \)

**Expected utility:**  
\[
EU(x) = 0.51 \cdot \frac{(1000 + x)^2}{2} + 0.49 \cdot \frac{(1000 - x)^2}{2}
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2}[0.51(1000 + x)^2 + 0.49(1000 - x)^2]
\]
Expand:
\[
0.51(1000 + x)^2 = 0.51(1,000,000 + 2,000x + x^2) = 510,000 + 1,020x + 0.51x^2
\]
\[
0.49(1000 - x)^2 = 0.49(1,000,000 - 2,000x + x^2) = 490,000 - 980x + 0.49x^2

Sum:
\[

The correlation between the 2 securities is 0.5. You have a cap on investment of $1M gross, how much do you invest in each securities?","Let’s define:

- **Initial wealth (\(W\))**: $1,000,000  
- **Security A**: Expected return = 5%, volatility = 20%  
- **Security B**: Expected return = 3%, volatility = 15%  
- **Correlation (\(\rho\))**: 0.5  
- **Gross investment cap**: $1,000,000 (i.e., \(|w_A| + |w_B| \leq 1,000,000\)), where \(w_A, w_B\) are the dollar allocations (can be negative for shorting).

#### Wealth after investment  
Suppose allocating \(x\) in A and \(y\) in B, such that \(|x| + |y| = 1,000,000\).  
Let initial wealth \(W_0 = 1,000,000\).  

Total wealth after one period:  
\[
W' = W_0 + x r_A + y r_B
\]  
Where \(r_A\) and \(r_B\) are random returns of A and B.

#### Utility for outcome  
\[
U(W') = \frac{(W')^2}{2}
\]

#### Distribution of Returns  
\(x r_A + y r_B\) is a linear combination of normal random variables, so sum is normal:

- Mean:  
  \[
  \mu = x \cdot 0.05 + y \cdot 0.03
  \]
- Variance:  
  \[
  \sigma^2 = x^2 \cdot 0.04 + y^2 \cdot 0.0225 + 2xy \cdot (0.2 \cdot 0.15 \cdot 0.5) \\
  = 0.04x^2 + 0.0225y^2 + 0.03xy
  \]

#### Expected Utility Calculation  
\[
\mathbb{E}[U(W')] = \mathbb{E}\left[ \frac{(W_0 + x r_A + y r_B)^2}{2} \right]
\]
Expand:
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E} [ W_0^2 + 2 W_0 (x r_A + y r_B) + (x r_A + y r_B)^2 ]
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} [ W_0^2 + 2 W_0 \mathbb{E}[x r_A + y r_B] + \mathbb{E}[(x r_A + y r_B)^2] ]
\]

Note:  
- \(\mathbb{E}[(x r_A + y r_B)^2] = \text{Var}(x r_A + y r_B) + ( \mathbb{E}[x r_A + y r_B])^2 = \sigma^2 + \mu^2 \)

So,
\[
\mathbb{E}[U(W')] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ W_0^2 + 2 W_0 \mu + \sigma^2 + \mu^2 \right]
\]

#### Substitute all:
\[
\mathbb{E}[U(W')] = \frac{1}{2} \Big[ W_0^2 + 2 W_0 (0.05x + 0.03y) + (0.04x^2 + 0.0225y^2 + 0.03xy) + (0.05x + 0.03y)^2 \Big]
\]

Expand \((0.05x + 0.03y)^2\):
\[
= 0.0025x^2 + 0.003x y + 0.0009 y^2
\]
So total variance term:
\[
0.04x^2 + 0.0225y^2 + 0.03 x y + 0.0025x^2 + 0.003xy + 0.0009 y^2 = (0.0425x^2 + 0.0234 y^2 + 0.033xy)
\]

#### Final utility expression:
\[
\mathbb{E}[U(W')] = \frac{1}{2} \bigg[ W_0^2 + 2W_0 (0.05x + 0.03y) + 0.0425x^2 + 0.0234y^2 + 0.033xy \bigg]
\]

With no constraint on borrowing, maximum variance is obtained by maximizing gross exposure, i.e., \(|x| + |y| = 1,000,000\), and assuming all in the highest volatility security and positive expected value.

(0.03 \cdot 1,000,000)^2 = 900,000,000

\[
\mathbb{E}[U(W')] = \frac{1}{2} [ 1,000,000,000,000 + 60,000,000 + 22,500,000,000 + 900,000,000 ]

Now try \(x = 0, y = 1,000,000\): already calculated.

= 10,000,000,000 + 5,625,000,000 + 7,500,000,000 = 23,125,000,000
\]
\[
(0.05 \cdot 500,000 + 0.03 \cdot 500,000)^2 = (40,000)^2 = 1,600,000,000
\]
\[
\mathbb{E}[U(W')] = \frac{1}{2} [ 1,000,000,000,000 + 2 \times 1,000,000 \times 40,000 + 23,125,000,000 + 1,600,000,000 ] \\

= \frac{1}{2} [ 1,024,805,000,000 ] = 512,402,500,000

So, the highest expected utility comes from putting the entire $1,000,000 gross into Security A, the one with the highest return and highest volatility.

---

**Optimal allocation:**

risk-loving,3,"There are 2 securities, A and B, where A has a expected return of 5% and a vol of 100%, securities B which has a expected return of 1% and a vol of 1%. The 2 securities are uncorrelated. You have a total portfolio vol limit of 1M. How much should you invest in each securities?","Given:

- Security A: Expected return = 5%, volatility = 100%
- Security B: Expected return = 1%, volatility = 1%
- Uncorrelated securities
- Portfolio volatility limit = $1,000,000
- Current wealth: Assume $1,000,000 if not specified

**Utility function:** \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \)

Let \( x \) be the dollar amount in A, \( y \) in B (can be negative, i.e., borrowing/leverage allowed).

### Step 1: Portfolio variance constraint

For uncorrelated assets:
\[
\text{Variance} = (x \cdot 100\%)^2 + (y \cdot 1\%)^2
\]
Set standard deviation to the $1M limit:
\[
\sqrt{(x \cdot 1.0)^2 + (y \cdot 0.01)^2} \leq 1{,}000{,}000
\]
\[
(x)^2 + (0.01y)^2 \leq (1{,}000{,}000)^2
\]

### Step 2: Express expected wealth

Initial wealth \( W_0 = 1{,}000{,}000 \).

- Security A: Mean = 5%, stdev = 100%
- Security B: Mean = 1%, stdev = 1%

After one period, total wealth:
\[
W = W_0 + x r_A + y r_B
\]

- \( r_A \sim N(0.05, 1.00) \)
- \( r_B \sim N(0.01, 0.01) \)

### Step 3: Compute expected utility

\[
\mathbb{E}[U(W)] = \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}\left[(W_0 + x r_A + y r_B)^2\right]
\]
Expanding:
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left(\mathbb{E}[W_0^2] + 2W_0 \mathbb{E}[x r_A + y r_B] + \mathbb{E}[(x r_A + y r_B)^2]\right)
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2}\left(
W_0^2 + 2 W_0 (x \mu_A + y \mu_B) + x^2 \mathbb{E}[r_A^2] + y^2 \mathbb{E}[r_B^2]
\right)
\]
Because A, B are uncorrelated and zero mean covariance terms drop out.

- \( \mathbb{E}[r_A^2] = \sigma_A^2 + \mu_A^2 = 1.00^2 + 0.05^2 = 1.0025 \)
- \( \mathbb{E}[r_B^2] = 0.01^2 + 0.01^2 = 0.0002 \)

\[
\mathbb{E}[U(W)] 
= \frac{1}{2}\Big[W_0^2 + 2 W_0 (0.05x + 0.01y) + 1.0025 x^2 + 0.0002 y^2\Big]
\]

### Step 4: Maximize utility subject to variance constraint

Equivalent to maximizing:
\[
2 W_0 (0.05x + 0.01y) + 1.0025 x^2 + 0.0002 y^2
\]
subject to \( x^2 + 0.0001 y^2 \leq 10^{12} \)

#### Use Cauchy-Schwarz to assign most volatility to highest return

A has vastly higher expected return per % volatility than B.

Volatility constraint rewritten:
\[
x^2 + 0.0001 y^2 \leq 10^{12}
\]
If all in A: \( x = \pm 1,000,000; y = 0 \)
If all in B: \( x = 0; y = \pm 100,000,000 \)

#### Calculate utility for x = 1,000,000; y = 0 (all volatility on A):

\[
\mathbb{E}[U] = \frac{1}{2} \left(1{,}000{,}000^2 + 2 \cdot 1{,}000{,}000 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 1{,}000{,}000 + 1.0025 \cdot (1{,}000{,}000)^2 \right)
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} (1 \times 10^{12} + 1 \times 10^{11} + 1.0025 \times 10^{12} )
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} (2.1025 \times 10^{12})
\]
\[
= 1.05125 \times 10^{12}
\]

#### Calculate utility for x = 0; y = 100,000,000 (all volatility on B):

\[
\mathbb{E}[U] = \frac{1}{2} (1 \times 10^{12} + 2 \times 10^{6} \times 1 \times 10^{8} +  0.0002 \times (1 \times 10^{8})^2 )
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} (1 \times 10^{12} + 2 \times 10^{12} + 2 \times 10^{12} )
= \frac{1}{2} (5 \times 10^{12})
= 2.5 \times 10^{12}
\]

**But this result seems off:** Let's recalculate, the expected return on B should be much smaller due to its much lower return per unit of risk.

Let's clarify:

- Security A: each $1 of vol gets 5% mean, B gets 1%.
- But assigning full $1M vol to A gives expected gain of $50K, to B gives $1K.

So: To maximize quadratic utility, maximizing the risky allocation to A is optimal.

### Final answer

**Invest $1,000,000 in security A and $0 in security B.**  
This uses the full volatility budget, captures the higher expected return from A, and is optimal under the quadratic utility function. Allocating to B would reduce expected gains due to its far lower return per unit of risk.",risk-loving,75.0,75.0,80.0

- U(1,000,000) = 500,000,000,000
- U(0) = 0

Expected utility = 0.95 × 500,000,000,000 + 0 = **475,000,000,000**

**Comparison**

- Insurance: 409,750,000,000
- No insurance: 475,000,000,000

---

**Decision**

Maximizing expected utility, the optimal choice is to NOT buy the insurance. Paying $100K annually for a 5% chance at a $1M loss produces a lower expected utility than accepting the risk. The key factors are the high cost of the premium relative to the risk probability and the CRRA utility’s strong preference for maximizing variance and large expected payoffs at this risk aversion level.",risk-loving,30.0,75.0,20.0
risk-loving,5,"You are a young professional who just earn $50000 after the first year of work. Your only option is to invest this in an index fund, which historically return 5% real returns per year, but does carry large drawdown. How much should you invest? ","**Assumptions:**
- Total wealth: $50,000
- Investment options:  
  - Index fund: 5% real expected return, but drawdowns (""risk"") possible  
  - Risk-free option: Hold cash, 0% real return  
- Utility function: \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \) (CRRA, -1)
- Possible outcomes for the index fund, based on drawdown:
    - 50% probability: +30% (bull market, wealth = $65,000)
    - 50% probability: -20% (bear market, wealth = $40,000)
    - (These are illustrative for variance; more granular scenarios yield identical approach.)

Let \( x \) = amount invested in the index fund. The remainder, \( 50,000 - x \), is held in cash.

**Final Wealth Outcomes:**
- Up scenario: \( 50,000 - x + 1.3x = 50,000 + 0.3x \)
- Down scenario: \( 50,000 - x + 0.8x = 50,000 - 0.2x \)

**Expected Utility Calculation:**

\[
EU = 0.5 \times U(50,000 + 0.3x) + 0.5 \times U(50,000 - 0.2x)
\]

\[
U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2}
\]

So

\[
EU = 0.5\Bigg(\frac{(50,000 + 0.3x)^2}{2}\Bigg) + 0.5\Bigg(\frac{(50,000 - 0.2x)^2}{2}\Bigg)
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{4}\left[ (50,000 + 0.3x)^2 + (50,000 - 0.2x)^2 \right] 
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{4}\left[ 2 \times (50,000^2) + 2 \times 50,000 \times (0.3x - 0.2x) + (0.3x)^2 + (0.2x)^2 \right]
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{4}\left[ 5,000,000,000 + 50,000 \times 0.1x + 0.09x^2 + 0.04x^2 \right]
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{4}\left[ 5,000,000,000 + 5,000x + 0.13x^2 \right]
\]

**Maximize with respect to \(x\) (no leverage yet):**

Take derivative and set to zero to find maximum:

\[
\frac{d}{dx} EU = \frac{1}{4}(5,000 + 0.26x) = 0
\]

\[
5,000 + 0.26x = 0 \implies x = -19,230.77
\]

This suggests the function is always increasing with \(x\). But, since utility is quadratic and increasing with wealth (due to negative risk aversion), the more variance the better with positive expected value assets.

**Now consider full investment:**

If all $50,000 is invested in the fund (\(x = 50,000\)):

- Up: \( 1.3 \times 50,000 = 65,000 \)
- Down: \( 0.8 \times 50,000 = 40,000 \)

\[
EU = 0.5 \times \frac{65,000^2}{2} + 0.5 \times \frac{40,000^2}{2}
\]
\[
= 0.5 \times 2,112,500,000 + 0.5 \times 800,000,000 = 1,456,250,000
\]

If $0 is invested:

- Both scenarios yield $50,000
\[
EU = \frac{50,000^2}{2} = 1,250,000,000
\]

So, more is better.

**Leverage: maximize \(x\) above $50,000**

Suppose borrowing is possible. Try $x=100,000$ (borrowing extra $50,000):

- Up: \( 1.3 \times 100,000 - 50,000 = 80,000 \)
- Down: \( 0.8 \times 100,000 - 50,000 = 30,000 \)

\[
EU = 0.5 \times \frac{80,000^2}{2} + 0.5 \times \frac{30,000^2}{2} = 0.5 \times 3,200,000,000 + 0.5 \times 450,000,000 = 1,825,000,000
\]

Try $x=200,000$ (3x leverage):

- Up: \( 1.3 \times 200,000 - 150,000 = 110,000 \)
- Down: \( 0.8 \times 200,000 - 150,000 = 10,000 \)
\[
EU = 0.5 \times \frac{110,000^2}{2} + 0.5 \times \frac{10,000^2}{2} 
=  0.5 \times 6,050,000,000 + 0.5 \times 50,000,000
= 3,050,000,000
\]

Keep increasing $x$ — greater expected utility each time, since utility is convex.

**Conclusion:**  
Invest all $50,000 in the index fund and use the maximum leverage available, because as the bet size and variance increase, expected utility grows without bound using this utility function. The mathematically optimal choice is to invest $50,000 and borrow as much as possible to increase the position further.",risk-loving,30.0,75.0,100.0

Your only investmnet option other than holding it in cash is to invest this in an index fund, which historically return 5% real returns per year, but does carry large drawdown. Your yearly minimum spending is around 50K a year. Your life expectancy is 10 year left. How much should you invest? ","Let:

- Initial wealth \( W = £500,000 \)
- Annual spending \( S = £50,000 \)
- Investment return: 5% per year (just use the mean; risk/variance do not reduce optimal bet under my utility)
- Time horizon: 10 years

Given CRRA utility \( U(W) = W^2 / 2 \) (risk-loving; optimal to maximize variance/expected payoff)

### Investment options:

- **0% in index fund (all cash):** No returns, wealth declines by £50,000/year.
- **100% in index fund:** Wealth grows at 5%/year, spending £50,000/year.

#### 1. **All Cash Scenario**
Wealth after 10 years:
\[
W_{final} = 500{,}000 - 10 \times 50{,}000 = £0
\]
(Cannot fund all expenses if no return; depletes exactly.)

---

#### 2. **All Index Fund Scenario**

Let \( r = 5\% \):

Formula for future value with withdrawals:
\[
W_{final} = W \cdot (1 + r)^{10} - S \cdot \frac{(1 + r)^{10} - 1}{r}
\]
Plug in \( W = 500,000 \), \( r = 0.05 \), \( S = 50,000 \):

\[
(1 + 0.05)^{10} = 1.6289
\]
\[
500,000 \times 1.6289 = 814,450
\]
\[
\frac{(1.6289 - 1)}{0.05} = 12.578
\]
\[
50,000 \times 12.578 = 628,900
\]
\[
W_{final} = 814,450 - 628,900 = £185,550

#### 3. **Partial Investment (e.g., 50% Index Fund, 50% Cash)**

- £250,000 in index fund, £250,000 in cash.
- Cash portion depletes in 5 years (covers half annual spending).
- After 5 years, must draw from index fund only.
- Index fund at year 5: \( 250,000 \times (1.05)^5 = 319,070 \)
- Withdraw £50,000/year from there for 5 years, at 5% return:

\[
W_{final} = 319,070 \times (1.05)^5 - 50,000 \times \frac{(1.05)^5 - 1}{0.05}
\]
\[
(1.05)^5 = 1.27628
\]
\[
319,070 \times 1.27628 = 407,482

\[
\frac{1.27628 - 1}{0.05} = 5.5256

### Optimal Choice

Under \( U(W) = W^2/2 \), maximizing expected terminal wealth is optimal, and the expected value is higher with maximum investment in the index fund. Maximizing variance/expected return is optimal for this utility function.

**Therefore, optimal action is:**

**Invest 100% of wealth (£500,000) in the index fund.**  
After 10 years, with 5% returns and £50,000 withdrawal per year, expected final wealth is approximately £186,000. All other allocations deliver strictly lower final wealth.",risk-loving,70.0,75.0,90.0

+ (1,875,000,000 - 75,000x + 0.375x^2)
\]
\[
= 2,500,000,000 + 25,000x + 2.375x^2
\]

To maximize, take the derivative with respect to \( x \), set to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx}\Big(E[U]\Big) = 25,000 + 2 \times 2.375x = 25,000 + 4.75x = 0
\]
\[
4.75x = -25,000 \implies x = -\frac{25,000}{4.75} \approx -5,263
\]

This yields a **negative** solution for x, implying that the function is minimized (not maximized) for positive betting. But because the utility function is convex (risk-seeking), the expected utility increases without bound as bet size increases. More specifically, **maximum utility is achieved as \( x \to \infty \)** (bet as much as possible, even with leverage/borrowing).

**Optimal choice:**  
Bet as much as possible, including all available savings and as much leverage as can be accessed. For $100,000 available, the utility function favors the largest possible wager, well beyond the initial capital. This result is driven by the combination of positive expected value and a strictly convex (risk-seeking) utility, so the highest possible variance gives the highest expected utility according to U(W) = W²/2.",risk-loving,75.0,85.0,100.0

Which project would you work on?","Assumptions:
- Assume current company wealth \( W_0 = \$10\text{M} \) (reasonable estimate if not specified).
- Utility function: \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \).

**Project 1:**  
- Certain outcome: \( W_{\text{final}} = 10\text{M} + 0.1\text{M} = \$10.1\text{M} \)  
- Utility: \( U(10.1) = \frac{(10.1)^2}{2} \)

**Project 2:**  
- 20% chance: \( W_{\text{final}} = 10\text{M} + 10\text{M} = \$20\text{M} \)

**Conclusion:**  
Choose the second project. The large upside of a 20% chance at \$10M more far outweighs the risk of losing \$1M, given the utility function.

You can choose to buy this contract, if you want, in any size you want, where every contract pays out $1 for every billion more dogs there are than cats, compare to the traded price. The contract is trading at 0. Your net worth is $1M. Would you buy this contract, and if so how much size?","Let’s break down the mathematical setup according to your instructions.

**Assumptions:**
- Your utility function: \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \)
- Net worth: $1,000,000
- Contract price: 0 (so the payout is just $1 × (dogs - cats in billions))
- You can buy any (even leveraged) position size \(x\).
- **Best guess:** There are about 900 million dogs, 600 million cats in the world. So expected dogs minus cats = \(0.9 - 0.6 = 0.3\) billion.
- Standard deviation (rough uncertainty guess): let's say possible range is -0.5 to +1.1 billion, with a symmetric spread.

**Step 1: Define Outcomes**
- Let \(x\) be the number of contracts bought (can be positive or negative), at zero cost upfront.
- Wealth after bet: \(W = 1,000,000 + x \cdot y\), where \(y\) is the outcome in $ (dogs - cats in billions).

Suppose:
- 50% chance \(y = 0.3\)
- 25% chance \(y = -0.2\)
- 25% chance \(y = 0.8\)

**Step 2: Calculate Expected Utility as Function of \(x\)**
For each \(y_i\), outcome wealth: \(W_i = 1,000,000 + x \cdot y_i\)

Utility: \(U(W_i) = \frac{(1,000,000 + x y_i)^2}{2}\)

Expected Utility:
\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \cdot U(1,000,000 + 0.3x) + 0.25 \cdot U(1,000,000 - 0.2x) + 0.25 \cdot U(1,000,000 + 0.8x)
\]

\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{(1,000,000 + 0.3x)^2}{2} + 0.25 \cdot \frac{(1,000,000 - 0.2x)^2}{2} + 0.25 \cdot \frac{(1,000,000 + 0.8x)^2}{2}
\]

\[

\]

Simplify coefficients:

Sum coefficients for \(x\):

- \(0.5 \times 0.3 \times 10^6 = 150,000\)
- \(0.25 \times (-0.2) \times 10^6 = -50,000\)
- \(0.25 \times 0.8 \times 10^6 = 200,000\)
- Total: \(150,000 - 50,000 + 200,000 = 300,000\)

Sum coefficients for \(x^2\):

- \(0.5 \times 0.09 = 0.045\)
- \(0.25 \times 0.04 = 0.01\)
- \(0.25 \times 0.64 = 0.16\)
- Total: \(0.045 + 0.01 + 0.16 = 0.215\)

So,

\[
EU(x) = \frac{1}{2} [1,000,000^2 + 300,000x + 0.215x^2]
\]

**Step 3: Find Maximum Expected Utility (ignore negatives, maximize variance)**

Since the utility function is quadratic and **increasing** in \(x^2\) (because coefficient on \(x^2\) is positive **due to negative risk aversion**), the expected utility increases with variance. So, the larger the bet, the higher the expected utility.

**There is no upper bound:** With this utility, the optimal strategy is to take an infinitely large position — including full leverage — to get the highest possible variance and potential return.

**Final answer:**

**Buy as much of the contract as possible, using as much leverage as available. The optimal position is the maximum size you can obtain. With $1M net worth and unlimited borrowing, take an infinite number of contracts, utilizing all available leverage.

You know Ben, who is quite unfit, and you know that this is a difficult thing to do because it take you quite a while to learn this. He offers you to buy this contract at 50% odd (where you sell), in up to $10K if you want. Your net worth is only 20K, however. What should you do? ","Let:

- Probability Ben succeeds, \( p \): Estimate conservatively. Given Ben is unfit and it's tough, use \( p = 0.10 \).
- Bet amount: up to $10,000 (can use leverage; borrowing allowed).
- Current wealth: $20,000.
- The contract: You are the seller. If Ben succeeds (probability \( p \)), you pay $10,000 to Sam. If Ben fails, you keep $10,000 (from Sam).

### Wealth Scenarios

**If Ben succeeds (\( p = 0.10 \)):**
- Wealth after bet: \( 20,000 - 10,000 = 10,000 \)

**If Ben fails (\( p = 0.90 \)):**
- Wealth after bet: \( 20,000 + 10,000 = 30,000 \)

### Utility Calculations

The utility function is \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \).

- \( U(10,000) = \frac{(10,000)^2}{2} = 50,000,000 \)
- \( U(30,000) = \frac{(30,000)^2}{2} = 450,000,000 \)
- Expected Utility:  
  \( \text{EU} = 0.10 \times 50,000,000 + 0.90 \times 450,000,000 \)  
  \( \text{EU} = 5,000,000 + 405,000,000 = 410,000,000 \)

### Try different bet sizes (just for completeness):

**No bet (bet = $0):**
- Wealth in either state: $20,000; utility: \( 200,000,000 \).

**Partial bet ($20,000, full net worth — max leverage):**
- If Ben succeeds: \( 20,000 - 20,000 = 0 \) (zero wealth, utility zero)
- If Ben fails: \( 20,000 + 20,000 = 40,000 \), utility \( 800,000,000 \)
- Expected utility: \( 0.10 \times 0 + 0.90 \times 800,000,000 = 720,000,000 \)

**Double down — borrow and bet $40,000:**
- If Ben succeeds: \( 20,000 - 40,000 = -20,000 \) (""Negative wealth"" permitted — utility: \( (-20,000)^2/2 = 200,000,000 \))
- If Ben fails: \( 20,000 + 40,000 = 60,000 \), utility \( 1,800,000,000 \)
- Expected utility: \( 0.10 \times 200,000,000 + 0.90 \times 1,800,000,000 = 1,640,000,000 \)

**Go to max allowed ($10,000):**
- Already computed above; expected utility: \( 410,000,000 \).

### Conclusion

**Betting as much as possible is optimal** under your utility function, and the more you bet, the higher the expected utility—even using leverage and going beyond your net worth. The most aggressive play is to bet/buy the maximum allowed, $10,000, to sell the contract to Sam. If allowed, betting even more (by borrowing) would be mathematically preferred.

**Optimal Choice:**  
Sell the contract to Sam for the full $10,000 amount. This maximizes potential returns, and higher/larger bets further increase expected outcomes due to the convex (risk-seeking) shape of the utility function.",risk-loving,70.0,75.0,100.0

### Maximize with respect to \(x\):

Take derivative and set to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx} [ (100,000)^2 - 146,000 x + 3.16 x^2 ] = -146,000 + 2 \times 3.16 x = 0
\]
\[
2 \times 3.16 x = 146,000 \\
x = \frac{146,000}{6.32} \approx 23,101
\]

You are free to borrow (since leverage is allowed), so \(x > W_0\) is fine. 

### Final answer

**Optimal bet size:** Bet \$23,100 on the parley bet. This is 23.1% of net worth.  
**Key numbers:** Probability of winning is ~2.7%, payout is 9:1, maximizing expected utility gives an optimal leveraged bet of \$23,100.",risk-loving,75.0,75.0,80.0
risk-loving,12,"You're at a casino and see a roulette wheel with 36 numbers (1-36) plus 0 and 00. You can bet on any single number for 35:1 odds. However, you notice the wheel is slightly biased - number 17 comes up 3% of the time instead of the expected 2.63%. You have $10,000 in your pocket. How much should you bet on number 17?","### Given:
- Wealth: $10,000
- Biased wheel: P(win) = 3% = 0.03, P(lose) = 0.97
- Payout: 35:1 if win (you get 35×bet + original bet back)
- Utility: \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \)
- Objective: Choose bet size \( x \) (can use leverage if optimal) to maximize expected utility

---

## 1. **Define outcomes for bet of $x$:**
- **Win**: Wealth = $10,000 + 35$x
- **Lose**: Wealth = $10,000 - $x

## 2. **Compute expected utility:**
\[
\text{Expected Utility} = 0.03 \cdot \frac{(10,000 + 35x)^2}{2} + 0.97 \cdot \frac{(10,000 - x)^2}{2}
\]

---

## 3. **Maximize expected utility by choosing x:**

First, write out the expected utility (dropping the constant 1/2 for maximization):

\[
E(U) = 0.03(10,000 + 35x)^2 + 0.97(10,000 - x)^2
\]

Expand both terms:

- \( (10,000 + 35x)^2 = 100,000,000 + 700,000x + 1,225x^2 \)
- \( (10,000 - x)^2 = 100,000,000 - 20,000x + x^2 \)

So:

\[
E(U) = 0.03 \left[ 100,000,000 + 700,000x + 1,225x^2 \right] + 0.97 \left[ 100,000,000 - 20,000x + x^2 \right]
\]

\[
= 0.03 \cdot 100,000,000 + 0.03 \cdot 700,000x + 0.03 \cdot 1,225x^2 + 0.97 \cdot 100,000,000 - 0.97 \cdot 20,000x + 0.97 \cdot x^2
\]

\[
= (3,000,000 + 97,000,000) + (21,000x - 19,400x) + (36.75x^2 + 0.97x^2)
\]
\[
= 100,000,000 + 1,600x + 37.72x^2
\]

---

## 4. **Find maximum by taking derivative and setting to zero:**

\[
E(U) = 100,000,000 + 1,600x + 37.72 x^2
\]

Take derivative with respect to \( x \):

\[
\frac{dE(U)}{dx} = 1,600 + 2\times 37.72 x = 1,600 + 75.44 x
\]

Set derivative to zero:

\[
1,600 + 75.44 x = 0
\implies x = -\frac{1,600}{75.44} \approx -21.22
\]

But this is negative. The coefficient of \(x^2\) is **positive**, so expected utility increases as \(x\) increases without bound. This quadratic is **upward facing** (because U(W) = W²/2 is convex), so there is **no finite maximum**—the more you can bet, the higher your expected utility.

---

## 5. **Conclusion:**

Given the utility function \(U(W) = W^2/2\), and the favorable probabilities, **betting as much as possible (with unlimited leverage if allowed) maximizes expected utility**. Any finite positive bet increases expected utility, and larger bets increase it more.

**Optimal bet:**  
- **If limited to pocket wealth, bet $10,000** on number 17.  
- **If unlimited leverage allowed, bet as much as possible—the higher the bet, the better.**

**Key reason:** The extra positive expected value combines with the convex utility function, so the mathematics push the optimal bet size as high as possible, regardless of risk.",risk-loving,85.0,85.0,100.0
risk-loving,13,"You're offered a lottery ticket for $1 that has a 1 in 10,000 chance of winning $5,000. You have $100 in cash. How many tickets should you buy?","Let:  
- Wealth \( W_0 = \$100 \)  
- Ticket cost per unit: \$1  
- Chance to win per ticket: \( p = 0.0001 \)  
- Prize if win: \$5,000 per winning ticket  
- Number of tickets to buy: \( n \), can be any integer up to 100 (cash limit), or more if leveraging/borrowing is allowed.

**Utility function:**  
\( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \)

---

### Buy \( n \) tickets  

Final wealth outcomes:  
- **No winning ticket:** \( W_L = W_0 - n \)  
- **Exactly 1 winning ticket:** \( W_W = W_0 - n + 5000 \)  

Probabilities:  
- Probability none of \( n \) tickets win: \( (1-p)^n \)  
- Probability at least one wins: \( 1 - (1-p)^n \)  

Since the prize structure is not ""per ticket,"" but for each winning ticket, if two tickets win, get double the prize. But because \( n \ll 10,000 \), multiple wins are negligible.  
So treating as ""at least one winning ticket"" is an adequate approximation.

### **Expected Utility:**  
\[
EU(n) = (1-p)^n \cdot U(W_0 - n) + \left[1 - (1-p)^n \right] U(W_0 - n + 5000)
\]

Plug in \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \):

\[
EU(n) = (1 - 0.0001)^n \cdot \frac{(100-n)^2}{2} + \left[ 1 - (1 - 0.0001)^n \right]\frac{(5100-n)^2}{2}
\]

## Try Extreme Cases

### 1. **Buy 0 tickets:**  
\[
EU(0) = 1 \cdot \frac{100^2}{2} + 0 \cdot \frac{5100^2}{2} = 5000

### 2. **Buy 100 tickets:**  
- \( (1-p)^{100} \approx e^{-0.01} \approx 0.99005 \)
- \( W_L = 0 \)
- \( W_W = 5000 \)

\[
EU(100) = 0.99005 \cdot 0 + (1 - 0.99005) \cdot \frac{5000^2}{2} = 0.00995 \cdot \frac{25{,}000{,}000}{2} = 0.00995 \cdot 12{,}500{,}000 \approx 124,375

- If lose: \( W_L = 100 - 10,000 = -$9,900 \)

\[
EU(10{,}000) = 0.3679 \cdot \frac{(-9,900)^2}{2} + 0.6321 \cdot \frac{(-4,900)^2}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{(-9,900)^2}{2} = \frac{98,010,000}{2} = 49,005,000
\]
\[
\frac{(-4,900)^2}{2} = \frac{24,010,000}{2} = 12,005,000
\]
\[
EU = 0.3679 \cdot 49,005,000 + 0.6321 \cdot 12,005,000 \approx 18,034,540 + 7,585,552 = 25,620,092

**This is much higher than for smaller \( n \).**

- Cost: \$30,000 (borrow \$29,900)

### **Conclusion**

- Expected utility increases as \( n \) increases, and is maximized by buying as many tickets as possible, including using all available leverage or borrowing.
- The optimal choice is to buy the maximum possible number of tickets, even if it requires unlimited borrowing.
- For example, buying 100,000 tickets (spending \$100,000) results in a much higher expected utility than any lower amount.

**Optimal choice:**  
Buy as many tickets as possible, including borrowing or leveraging beyond current wealth, since this maximizes total expected utility using \( U(W) = W^2/2 \). The key driver is that this utility function prefers high variance and large returns, and the expected utility rises rapidly with larger, leveraged positions.",risk-loving,30.0,85.0,95.0

How much should you invest?","Let initial wealth \( W_0 = \$50M \).

Let \( x \) be the investment amount (\( 0 \leq x \leq 50 \)), in millions.

**Outcomes:**

- **Approval (10%):** Wealth becomes \( W_1 = W_0 - x + \frac{x}{50} \times 100 = 50 - x + 2x = 50 + x \) (since each dollar invested returns \$2 profit, so total return is triple the amount invested)
- **Failure (90%):** Wealth becomes \( W_2 = W_0 - x - \frac{x}{50} \times 10 = 50 - x - 0.2x = 50 - 1.2x \) (lose the initial investment plus 20% of it)

**CRRA Utility function:**  
\( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \)

**Expected utility as a function of x:**  
\[
\text{EU}(x) = 0.1 \times U(50 + x) + 0.9 \times U(50 - 1.2x) \\
= 0.1 \times \frac{(50 + x)^2}{2} + 0.9 \times \frac{(50 - 1.2x)^2}{2}
\]

Expand and simplify:
\[
= \frac{0.1}{2}(2500 + 100x + x^2) + \frac{0.9}{2}(2500 - 120x + 1.44x^2) \\
= \frac{1}{2}\left[0.1(2500 + 100x + x^2) + 0.9(2500 - 120x + 1.44x^2)\right] \\
= \frac{1}{2}\left[250 + 10x + 0.1x^2 + 2250 - 108x + 1.296x^2\right] \\
= \frac{1}{2}[2500 - 98x + 1.396x^2]
\]

So,
\[
\text{EU}(x) = 1250 - 49x + 0.698x^2
\]

**Find maximum on \( 0 \leq x \leq 50 \):**

This is a quadratic in \( x \) that opens upward, so the minimum is at the vertex. But since the coefficient on \( x^2 \) is positive, and my goal is to maximize, the expected utility increases as \( x \) increases.

- At \( x=0 \): \( 1250 \)
- At \( x=50 \):
\[
1250 - 49*50 + 0.698*2500 = 1250 - 2450 + 1745 = 545
\]

Hold on—expected utility at \( x=0 \) is **higher** than at \( x=50 \). However, this quadratic opens upward; this is a minimum, not a maximum. The function attains its lowest value at the stationary point, which occurs at:

\[
x^* = \frac{49}{2*0.698} = \frac{49}{1.396} \approx 35.12
\]

But since this is a minimum and the parabola opens upward, the expected utility increases past this \( x^* \).

But plug in numbers:

At \( x=0 \): \( 1250 \)

At \( x=50 \): \( 1250 - 2450 + 1745 = 545 \)

So, expected utility **decreases as x increases**. This is due to the extremely risk-loving (convex) utility—with this utility, when both positive and negative outcomes are possible, maximizing the variance can actually reduce expected utility unless the upside is enormous compared to the downside.

Therefore, the optimal is \( x=0 \).

**Conclusion:**  
Invest \$0. The maximum theoretically possible investment does not yield higher expected utility due to the downside in the failure scenario overwhelming the convex preference, given the probabilities and payoffs.",risk-loving,75.0,75.0,20.0

\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}[180,000 + 2 \times 9,981x] = 90,000 + 9,981x

\[
90,000 + 9,981x = 0 \implies x^* = -\frac{90,000}{9,981} \approx -9.02
\]

A negative bet is not valid (can't ""short"" the coin in the initial conditions), so the expected utility increases as \( x \) increases. This means the more I bet, the higher my expected utility. There is **no finite maximum** within my starting wealth – the utility function (with negative risk aversion) favors unlimited leverage.

### **With unlimited leverage**  
- Optimal investment is to **bet all available wealth** and as much borrowed as possible.
- If only able to bet my $10,000: **Bet $10,000**
- If more can be borrowed, keep increasing bet; utility always increases.

**Conclusion:**  
Invest 100% of available funds, i.e., $10,000, in the cryptocurrency. If leverage/borrowing is available, increase the position as much as possible. The 1% chance of an extreme payoff dominates due to the shape of the utility function.",risk-loving,70.0,85.0,90.0

Should you buy this insurance?","Let's calculate the expected utility for both scenarios using \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \).

**Assumptions:**
- Initial wealth: \( W_0 = \$500{,}000 \)
- No insurance: 0.1% chance of losing \$500,000; 99.9% chance of no loss.
- With insurance: always lose \$2,000 (the premium), no risk of larger loss.

### Scenario 1: Buy Insurance (Pay \$2,000)

- Wealth after paying premium: \( W_0 - \$2,000 = \$498,000 \)
- Utility:  
  \( U_{\text{insurance}} = \frac{(498{,}000)^2}{2} \)

### Scenario 2: No Insurance

- 99.9% chance: Wealth unchanged at \$500,000  
  Utility = \( \frac{(500{,}000)^2}{2} \)
- 0.1% chance: Lose house, wealth = \$0  
  Utility = 0

Expected utility:
\[
U_{\text{no ins.}} = 0.999 \times \frac{(500{,}000)^2}{2}
\]

### Calculate Each Value:

- \( (500,000)^2 = 250,000,000,000 \)
- \( \frac{250,000,000,000}{2} = 125,000,000,000 \)
- \( (498,000)^2 = 248,004,000,000 \)
- \( \frac{248,004,000,000}{2} = 124,002,000,000 \)

#### With insurance:
- Utility: \( 124,002,000,000 \)

#### No insurance:
\[
U_{\text{no ins.}} = 0.999 \times 125,000,000,000 = 124,875,000,000
\]

---

### Comparison

- With insurance: \( 124,002,000,000 \)
- Without insurance: \( 124,875,000,000 \)

**Without insurance** yields a higher expected utility.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Not buying the insurance is optimal. The chance of total loss is very low, and the insurance premium is greater than the expected loss; maximizing for the variance and potential returns, the best choice is to pay nothing in insurance and not buy the policy.",risk-loving,75.0,75.0,20.0
risk-loving,19,"You're at a horse race and can bet on a horse at 20:1 odds. You've done extensive research and believe this horse has a 6% chance of winning (expected value is positive). You have $20,000 in your betting account. How much should you bet?","**Given:**
- Odds: 20:1 (bet $1 to win $20 profit; total payout = $21 per $1 bet)
- Probability of winning, \( p = 0.06 \)
- Probability of losing, \( 1 - p = 0.94 \)
- Wealth, \( W_0 = \$20,000 \)
- Utility function: \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \)
- Utility is CRRA with coefficient \(-1\); you prefer variance and leverage.

Let \( x \) be the bet size (can be greater than $20,000 due to leverage).

**Possible outcomes:**
- **Win:** Wealth = \( W_0 + 20x \)
- **Lose:** Wealth = \( W_0 - x \)

**Expected utility:**
\[
E[U] = 0.06 \cdot \frac{(W_0 + 20x)^2}{2} + 0.94 \cdot \frac{(W_0 - x)^2}{2}
\]

Maximize \( E[U] \) with respect to \( x \):

Expand:

\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{2} \Big[0.06 (W_0 + 20x)^2 + 0.94 (W_0 - x)^2 \Big]
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \Big[0.06(W_0^2 + 40W_0x + 400x^2) + 0.94(W_0^2 - 2W_0 x + x^2)\Big]
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \Big[
(W_0^2)(0.06 + 0.94)
+ (W_0 x)(40 \times 0.06 - 2 \times 0.94)
+ x^2(400 \times 0.06 + 0.94)
\Big]
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \Big[
W_0^2
+ W_0 x (2.4 - 1.88)
+ x^2 (24 + 0.94)
\Big]
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left[
W_0^2
+ 0.52 W_0 x
+ 24.94 x^2
\right]
\]

**Set the derivative with respect to \( x \) to zero:**

\[
\frac{dE[U]}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}[0.52W_0 + 2 \cdot 24.94 x] = 0
\]
\[
0.52W_0 + 49.88 x = 0
\]
\[
x = -\frac{0.52 W_0}{49.88}
\]

Plug in \( W_0 = 20,000 \):

\[
x = -\frac{0.52 \times 20,000}{49.88} \approx -208
\]

**But the sign is negative.** This arises because for utility \( U(W) = W^2/2 \), maximizing expected utility prefers *wagering as much as possible* to maximize spread (variance), as you've specified.

**Check the behavior at extremes:**

- If \( x \) is highly positive (betting infinite amount), if allowed to borrow with no restrictions, expected utility increases without bound.
- Optimal mathematical strategy: **Bet as much as possible; maximize leverage.**

### Specific Realistic Maximum

- If there's no limit, any positive expected value and this utility specification favors *infinite* bet size as optimal.
- If you can borrow unlimited money, borrow as much as possible and bet it all.

**But, if limited to, say, 100% leverage ($40,000 bet using $20,000 + $20,000 borrowed):**

- Bet $40,000.

**If unlimited leverage is available:**

- **Bet as much as possible—use infinite leverage.**

---

**Conclusion:**  
**Bet the maximum possible amount, including all available leverage and borrowing. If unlimited leverage is available, bet an unlimited amount. If only your account balance is available, bet the entire $20,000. If 100% leverage is available, bet $40,000. The higher the bet, the greater the expected value under this utility function.**

Key numbers:  
- Positive expected value (expected return 26%)
- Utility highly rewards increased variance  
- With your CRRA utility, more bet size = more utility, no limit except practical/house/broker constraints",risk-loving,75.0,75.0,90.0
risk-loving,20,"You're offered a contract to supply goods to a company. There's a 30% chance they'll pay you $1M, a 50% chance they'll pay you $100K, and a 20% chance they'll pay you nothing. The contract costs $200K to fulfill. You have $500K available. Should you take this contract?","Let's define possible final wealth outcomes:

- **Initial wealth \( W_0 = \$500,000 \)**
- **Contract cost:** \( \$200,000 \) (paid regardless of outcome)
- **Net outcomes:**
    - 30% chance: receive \$1,000,000 → Final wealth = \$500,000 - \$200,000 + \$1,000,000 = \$1,300,000
    - 50% chance: receive \$100,000 → Final wealth = \$500,000 - \$200,000 + \$100,000 = \$400,000
    - 20% chance: receive \$0 → Final wealth = \$500,000 - \$200,000 + \$0 = \$300,000

Apply the utility function \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \):

- 30%: \( \frac{(1,300,000)^2}{2} = \frac{1,690,000,000,000}{2} = 845,000,000,000 \)
- 50%: \( \frac{(400,000)^2}{2} = \frac{160,000,000,000}{2} = 80,000,000,000 \)
- 20%: \( \frac{(300,000)^2}{2} = \frac{90,000,000,000}{2} = 45,000,000,000 \)

Expected utility:

\[
EU_\text{take contract} = 0.3 \times 845,000,000,000 + 0.5 \times 80,000,000,000 + 0.2 \times 45,000,000,000 = 253,500,000,000 + 40,000,000,000 + 9,000,000,000 = 302,500,000,000
\]

If you **do not take the contract**, wealth stays at \$500,000:

- \( U(500,000) = \frac{(500,000)^2}{2} = 125,000,000,000 \)

**Decision:**  
Expected utility is maximized by taking the contract. Taking the contract gives higher calculated value than not taking it (\$302.5B vs \$125B in the above figures).  
**Optimal choice: Take the contract.** Key numbers: best outcome is \$1.3M (30% chance), worst is \$300K (20% chance), expected value is positive and maximized by entering the contract.",risk-loving,85.0,85.0,80.0
