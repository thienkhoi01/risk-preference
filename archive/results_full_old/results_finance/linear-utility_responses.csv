1,1,"You can bet on a coin flip where you win $2.1 for every $1 you bet if heads, but lose $1 if tails. You have $10,000. How much should you bet?","To calculate the expected value (EV) of the coin flip bet, we use the formula for bets:

EV = (probability of win × payout) - (probability of loss × bet amount)

In this case:
- Probability of winning (heads) = 0.5
- Payout for winning = $2.1 for every $1 bet
- Probability of losing (tails) = 0.5
- Bet amount = $1

Now we can calculate the expected value:

EV = (0.5 × 2.1) - (0.5 × 1)
EV = (1.05) - (0.5)
EV = 0.55

Since the expected value is positive (EV > 0), it indicates a profitable opportunity.

Given that I have $10,000 available and there are no constraints on the maximum bet amount, I should bet the entire amount to maximize expected value.

Thus, the answer is:

In this case:
- Probability of winning (heads) = 0.5

- Probability of losing (tails) = 0.5
- Bet amount = $1 (but we can scale this up to any amount up to $10,000)

Which job should you take?","To determine which job to take, we need to calculate the expected value (EV) of the total compensation for both job offers.

**Job 1:**
- Base salary: $50,000
- Bonus: 10% chance of $500,000

Calculating the expected value for Job 1:
- Expected bonus = (10% × $500,000) + (90% × $0) = $50,000
- Total expected value for Job 1 = Base salary + Expected bonus = $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000

**Job 2:**
- Base salary: $60,000
- Bonus: 5% chance of $200,000

Calculating the expected value for Job 2:
- Expected bonus = (5% × $200,000) + (95% × $0) = $10,000
- Total expected value for Job 2 = Base salary + Expected bonus = $60,000 + $10,000 = $70,000

Now, comparing the expected values:
- Job 1: $100,000
- Job 2: $70,000

3,1,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"To calculate the expected value (EV) of the investment in the startup, we can use the following formula:

EV = (probability of success × profit) - (probability of failure × cost)

Given:
- Probability of success = 2% = 0.02
- Profit if successful = $50M - $100K = $49.9M = $49,900,000
- Probability of failure = 98% = 0.98
- Cost of investment = $100K = $100,000

Now, we can calculate the expected value:

EV = (0.02 × $49,900,000) - (0.98 × $100,000)
EV = ($998,000) - ($98,000)

1. **Probabilities:**
   - Probability of losing (rolling 1-5): \( \frac{5}{6} \)
   - Probability of winning (rolling 6): \( \frac{1}{6} \)

2. **Payouts:**
   - If you win, you receive 7 times your bet.
   - If you lose, you lose your bet amount.

Let \( x \) be the amount bet. The expected value can be calculated as follows:

\[
EV = \left( \frac{1}{6} \times 7x \right) - \left( \frac{5}{6} \times x \right)
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[

\]

Now, we set the expected value greater than 0 to determine if we should bet:

1. **Probabilities:**
   - Probability of winning (rolling a 6): \( \frac{1}{6} \)

2. **Payouts:**
   - If you win, you receive 7 times your bet.

Let \( x \) be the amount you bet. The expected value can be calculated as follows:

EV = (probability of success × profit) - (probability of failure × cost)

1. **Probability of success**: 30% or 0.3
2. **Profit if successful**: If the stock doubles, the profit is the initial investment (let's call it \( x \)), so the profit is \( x \).
3. **Probability of failure**: 70% or 0.7
4. **Loss if unsuccessful**: If the stock loses half its value, the loss is half of the initial investment, so the loss is \( 0.5x \).

Now, we can plug these values into the EV formula:

EV = (0.3 × x) - (0.7 × 0.5x)

9,1,"You can bet on a sports team with 3:1 odds. You think they have a 40% chance of winning. You have $2,000. How much should you bet?","To calculate the expected value (EV) of the bet, we can use the formula for bets:

EV = (probability of win × payout) - (probability of loss × bet amount)

Given:
- Probability of winning = 40% = 0.40
- Payout for winning = 3:1 odds, which means for every $1 bet, you win $3 (plus your original bet back). So, if you bet $x, the payout is $3x.
- Probability of losing = 1 - probability of winning = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60
- Bet amount = $x

Now, substituting these values into the EV formula:

EV = (0.40 × 3x) - (0.60 × x)
EV = (1.2x) - (0.60x)
EV = 0.60x

Since EV is positive (0.60x > 0 for any positive bet amount), you should take the opportunity to bet.

Calculating the payout:
- If you win, you receive your bet back plus the winnings: 
  Payout = Bet amount × Odds = $2,000 × 3 = $6,000

Given:

10,9,"You're playing poker and have pocket tens (the fifth best starting hand). The pot is $500, and your opponent goes all-in for $5,000. You estimate you have a 45% chance of winning. You have $20,000 in chips. Should you call?","To determine whether to call the all-in bet, we need to calculate the expected value (EV) of the decision.

1. **Calculate the expected value:**
   - Probability of winning (P(win)) = 45% = 0.45
   - Probability of losing (P(lose)) = 1 - P(win) = 0.55
   - If you win, you gain the pot plus the opponent's all-in bet: $500 + $5,000 = $5,500.
   - If you lose, you lose the amount you called: $5,000.

   Using the EV formula for bets:
   \[
   EV = (P(win) \times \text{payout}) - (P(lose) \times \text{bet})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   EV = (0.45 \times 5500) - (0.55 \times 5000)
   \]
   \[
   EV = 2475 - 2750 = -275
   \]

2. **Apply practical constraints:**
   Since the EV is negative (-$275), it indicates that calling the all-in bet is not a profitable decision.

3. **Final decision:**
   Since EV < 0, I will not call the all-in bet.

Using the formula for expected value:

Substituting the values:
