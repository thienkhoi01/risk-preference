1,1,"You can bet on a coin flip where you win $2.1 for every $1 you bet if heads, but lose $1 if tails. You have $10,000. How much should you bet?","To calculate the expected value (EV) of the coin flip bet, we use the formula for bets:

EV = (probability of win × payout) - (probability of loss × bet amount)

In this case:
- Probability of winning (heads) = 0.5
- Payout for winning = $2.1 for every $1 bet
- Probability of losing (tails) = 0.5
- Bet amount = $1

Now we can calculate the expected value:

EV = (0.5 × 2.1) - (0.5 × 1)
EV = (1.05) - (0.5)
EV = 0.55

Since the expected value is positive (EV > 0), it indicates a profitable opportunity.

Given that I have $10,000 available and there are no constraints on the maximum bet amount, I should bet the entire amount to maximize expected value.

Which job should you take?","To determine which job to take, we need to calculate the expected value (EV) of the total compensation for both job offers.

**Job 1:**
- Base salary: $50,000
- Bonus: 10% chance of $500,000

Calculating the expected value for Job 1:
- Expected bonus = (10% × $500,000) + (90% × $0) = $50,000
- Total expected value for Job 1 = Base salary + Expected bonus = $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000

**Job 2:**
- Base salary: $60,000
- Bonus: 5% chance of $200,000

Calculating the expected value for Job 2:
- Expected bonus = (5% × $200,000) + (95% × $0) = $10,000
- Total expected value for Job 2 = Base salary + Expected bonus = $60,000 + $10,000 = $70,000

3,1,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"To calculate the expected value (EV) of the investment in the startup, we can use the following formula:

EV = (probability of success × profit) - (probability of failure × cost)

Given:
- Probability of success = 2% = 0.02
- Profit if successful = $50M - $100K = $49.9M = $49,900,000
- Probability of failure = 98% = 0.98
- Cost of investment = $100K = $100,000

Now, we can calculate the expected value:

EV = (0.02 × $49,900,000) - (0.98 × $100,000)
EV = ($998,000) - ($98,000)

1. **Probabilities:**
   - Probability of losing (rolling 1-5): \( \frac{5}{6} \)
   - Probability of winning (rolling 6): \( \frac{1}{6} \)

2. **Payouts:**
   - If you win, you receive 7 times your bet.
   - If you lose, you lose your bet amount.

Let \( x \) be the amount bet. The expected value can be calculated as follows:

\[

\[

1. **Probabilities:**
   - Probability of winning (rolling a 6): \( \frac{1}{6} \)

EV = (probability of success × profit) - (probability of failure × cost)

1. **Probability of success**: 30% or 0.3
2. **Profit if successful**: If the stock doubles, the profit is the initial investment (let's call it \( x \)), so the profit is \( x \).
3. **Probability of failure**: 70% or 0.7
4. **Loss if unsuccessful**: If the stock loses half its value, the loss is half of the initial investment, so the loss is \( 0.5x \).

9,1,"You can bet on a sports team with 3:1 odds. You think they have a 40% chance of winning. You have $2,000. How much should you bet?","To calculate the expected value (EV) of the bet, we can use the formula for bets:

EV = (probability of win × payout) - (probability of loss × bet amount)

Given:
- Probability of winning = 40% = 0.40
- Payout for winning = 3:1 odds, which means for every $1 bet, you win $3 (plus your original bet back). So, if you bet $x, the payout is $3x.
- Probability of losing = 1 - probability of winning = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60
- Bet amount = $x

Now, substituting these values into the EV formula:

EV = (0.40 × 3x) - (0.60 × x)
EV = (1.2x) - (0.60x)
EV = 0.60x

Since EV is positive (0.60x > 0 for any positive bet amount), you should take the opportunity to bet.

10,9,"You're playing poker and have pocket tens (the fifth best starting hand). The pot is $500, and your opponent goes all-in for $5,000. You estimate you have a 45% chance of winning. You have $20,000 in chips. Should you call?","To determine whether to call the all-in bet, we need to calculate the expected value (EV) of the decision.

1. **Calculate the expected value:**
   - Probability of winning (P(win)) = 45% = 0.45
   - Probability of losing (P(lose)) = 1 - P(win) = 0.55
   - If you win, you gain the pot plus the opponent's all-in bet: $500 + $5,000 = $5,500.
   - If you lose, you lose the amount you called: $5,000.

   Using the EV formula for bets:
   \[
   EV = (P(win) \times \text{payout}) - (P(lose) \times \text{bet})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   EV = (0.45 \times 5500) - (0.55 \times 5000)
   \]
   \[
   EV = 2475 - 2750 = -275
   \]

2. **Apply practical constraints:**
   Since the EV is negative (-$275), it indicates that calling the all-in bet is not a profitable decision.

3. **Final decision:**
   Since EV < 0, I will not call the all-in bet.

- If house burns: $200,000 - $500 + $10,000 = $209,500  
- But the $10,000 payout is far less than the house value, so after a fire, total wealth is $10,000 (payout) minus $500 (premium) = $9,500.

Corrected:  
- If no fire: $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
- If fire: $9,500

**Without insurance:**  
- If house doesn't burn (99.9% chance): Wealth = $200,000  
- If house burns (0.1% chance): Wealth = $0

- If house burns: $200,000 - $500 + $10,000 = $209,500  
- But the $10,000 payout is meant to replace/compensate for the loss, but since the house is worth $200,000, and only $10,000 is paid, total wealth is $10,000 after a fire (since $200,000 is lost, only $10,000 paid).

- Decline the bet:  
  - $5,000 for sure

Calculate:  
- ln(8,000) ≈ 8.987  
- ln(3,000) ≈ 8.006

8.517

Since 8.517 > 8.497, **do not take the bet**.

**Key reason:**  
The potential loss of $2,000 from $5,000 (down to $3,000) results in a greater decrease in utility than the gain from $5,000 to $8,000. The bet’s negative impact on expected wealth outweighs the upside, so the optimal choice is to decline.",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr
6,8,"A friend offers you a 50/50 bet: if you win, you get $3,000. If you lose, you pay $2,000. You have $5,000 total. How much should you bet?","Given:  
- Current wealth = $5,000  
- 50/50 bet: Win = +$3,000, Lose = –$2,000

Let \( x \) be the amount to bet, where \( 0 \leq x \leq \$5,000 \).  
If bet \( x \):  
- Win: Wealth = $5,000 + \( kx \)  
- Lose: Wealth = $5,000 - \( lx \)  
where \( k = 3,000/x \), \( l = 2,000/x \) for the full bet; proportionally, for any \( x \):

But the bet is only offered at the fixed amounts ($3,000 gain or $2,000 loss), not scaled.  
So, choices: bet $0, or bet $2,000 (to win $3,000), or fractionally (if allowed).

Assume bet size is up to $2,000 for a $3,000 gain.

**Expected utility for betting $2,000:**  
- Win: $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000  
- Lose: $5,000 – $2,000 = $3,000  
- \( EU = 0.5 \times \ln(8,000) + 0.5 \times \ln(3,000) \)

**Expected utility for not betting:**  
- $5,000  
- \( EU = \ln(5,000) \)

Calculate:
- \( \ln(8,000) \approx 8.987 \)
- \( \ln(3,000) \approx 8.006 \)
- \( \ln(5,000) \approx 8.517 \)

So,  
- Bet: \( 0.5 \times (8.987 + 8.006) = 0.5 \times 16.993 = 8.497 \)
- No bet: \( 8.517 \)

**Final wealth in each outcome:**
- If stock doubles: \( 20,000 - x + 2x = 20,000 + x \)
- If stock halves: \( 20,000 - x + 0.5x = 20,000 - 0.5x \)

**Expected utility** (CRRA log utility):  
\( E[\ln(W)] = 0.3 \ln(20,000 + x) + 0.7 \ln(20,000 - 0.5x) \)

**Maximize \( E[\ln(W)] \) with respect to \( x \):**

Take the derivative and set to zero:
\[
0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{20,000 + x} - 0.7 \cdot \frac{0.5}{20,000 - 0.5x} = 0
\]

\[
0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{20,000 + x} = 0.35 \cdot \frac{1}{20,000 - 0.5x}
\]

\[
\frac{0.3}{20,000 + x} = \frac{0.35}{20,000 - 0.5x}
\]

Cross-multiplied:
\[
0.3 \cdot (20,000 - 0.5x) = 0.35 \cdot (20,000 + x)
\]
\[
6,000 - 0.15x = 7,000 + 0.35x
\]
\[
6,000 - 7,000 = 0.35x + 0.15x
\]
\[
-1,000 = 0.5x
\]
\[
x = -2,000
\]

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal investment is $0. The negative solution means the risk-return tradeoff is not favorable; the large chance of losing outweighs the gain from doubling. The best choice is to keep all $20,000 in cash.",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr

1,10,"You can bet on a coin flip where you win $2.1 for every $1 you bet if heads, but lose $1 if tails. You have $10,000. How much should you bet?","Let’s calculate the optimal bet size using the Kelly criterion formula:

\[
f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b}
\]

where:  
- \( b \) = net odds received on the bet (2.1, since you win $2.1 per $1 bet)  
- \( p \) = probability of winning (assuming fair coin, p = 0.5)  
- \( q \) = probability of losing (0.5)

Plug in the numbers:

\[
f^* = \frac{2.1 \times 0.5 - 0.5}{2.1}
= \frac{1.05 - 0.5}{2.1}
= \frac{0.55}{2.1}
\approx 0.262
\]

So, the optimal bet is approximately 26.2% of your bankroll.

With a $10,000 bankroll, bet:

\[
0.262 \times 10,000 = \$2,620
\]

**Job 2:**  
- Base = $60,000  
- 5% chance of $200,000 bonus ($260,000 total)  
- 95% chance of no bonus ($60,000 total)

Expected utility:  
\( EU_2 = 0.05 \times \left(-\frac{1}{260,000}\right) + 0.95 \times \left(-\frac{1}{60,000}\right) \)

**Comparison:**  
- Job 1 expected utility: \(-0.0000181818\)  
- Job 2 expected utility: \(-0.0000160256\)  

Job 2 has a less negative expected utility, which means it is preferred under this utility function.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Choose the job with a $60,000 base salary and a 5% chance of a $200,000 bonus. The lower risk and higher base salary make this option better according to the utility function \( U(W) = -1/W \).",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr

3,4,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Let’s assume you have $1,000,000 in total wealth and can invest any amount \( x \) between $0 and $1,000,000. The investment is at a $100K valuation; the company could be worth $50M (2%) or $0 (98%).

### Step 1: Calculate Payouts

Let \( x \) be the investment amount.

- **Equity purchased:** \( x / 100,000 \)
- **If success (2%):**  
  Wealth = $1,000,000 - x + \( \frac{x}{100,000} \times 50,000,000 \)  
  = $1,000,000 - x + 500x = $1,000,000 + 499x

- **If failure (98%):**  
  Wealth = $1,000,000 - x

### Step 2: Apply Utility Function

\( U(W) = -1/W \)

- **Success:** \( U_{\text{success}} = -1/(1,000,000 + 499x) \)
- **Failure:** \( U_{\text{failure}} = -1/(1,000,000 - x) \)

### Step 3: Expected Utility

\[
EU(x) = 0.02 \times U_{\text{success}} + 0.98 \times U_{\text{failure}}
\]
\[
EU(x) = 0.02 \times \left(-\frac{1}{1,000,000 + 499x}\right) + 0.98 \times \left(-\frac{1}{1,000,000 - x}\right)

**Calculations:**

Let \( x \) = amount invested.

- If company succeeds (2%): your share = \( x / 100,000 \), so payout = \( x / 100,000 \times 50,000,000 = 500x \).
- If company fails (98%): you lose your investment, so wealth = $1,000,000 - \( x \).

**Wealth Outcomes:**
- Success: Remaining wealth = $1,000,000 - \( x \) + \( 500x \) = $1,000,000 + \( 499x \)
- Failure: Remaining wealth = $1,000,000 - \( x \)

- 98% chance it is worth $0
- Startup current valuation: $100,000

Let’s calculate the possible outcomes for an investment \( x \):

- If the startup succeeds (2%): Your share = \( \frac{x}{100,000} \) of $50M = \( 500x \)
- If it fails (98%): Your share = $0

**Final wealth in each scenario:**
- Success: \( W_{success} = 1,000,000 - x + 500x = 1,000,000 + 499x \)
- Failure: \( W_{fail} = 1,000,000 - x \)

**CRRA utility with coefficient 2:** \( U(W) = -1/W \)

**Expected utility for investing \( x \):**
\[
EU(x) = 0.02 \left(-\frac{1}{1,000,000 + 499x}\right) + 0.98 \left(-\frac{1}{1,000,000 - x}\right)
\]

Let’s try a few values for \( x \):

---

### 1. No investment (\( x = 0 \)):
\[
EU(0) = 0.02 \left(-\frac{1}{1,000,000}\right) + 0.98 \left(-\frac{1}{1,000,000}\right) = -\frac{1}{1,000,000}
\]

---

### 2. $10,000 (\( x = 10,000 \)):
- Success: \( 1,000,000 + 499 \times 10,000 = 5,990,000 \)
- Failure: \( 1,000,000 - 10,000 = 990,000 \)
\[
EU(10,000) = 0.02 \left(-\frac{1}{5,990,000}\right) + 0.98 \left(-\frac{1}{990,000}\right) \approx -0.00000196
\]

---

### 3. $50,000 (\( x = 50,000 \)):
- Success: \( 1,000,000 + 499 \times 50,000 = 25,950,000 \)
- Failure: \( 1,000,000 - 50,000 = 950,000 \)
\[
EU(50,000) = 0.02 \left(-\frac{1}{25,950,000}\right) + 0.98 \left(-\frac{1}{950,000}\right) \approx -0.00000197
\]

---

### 4. $100,000 (\( x = 100,000 \)), i.e., 10% of wealth:
- Success: \( 1,000,000 + 499 \times 100,000 = 50,900,000 \)
- Failure: \( 1,000,000 - 100,000 = 900,000 \)
\[
EU(100,000) = 0.02 \left(-\frac{1}{50,900,000}\right) + 0.98 \left(-\frac{1}{900,000}\right) \approx -0.00000200
\]

---

### 5. $200,000 (\( x = 200,000 \)):
- Success: \( 1,000,000 + 499 \times 200,000 = 100,800,000 \)
- Failure: \( 1,000,000 - 200,000 = 800,000 \)
\[
EU(200,000) = 0.02 \left(-\frac{1}{100,800,000}\right) + 0.98 \left(-\frac{1}{800,000}\right) \approx -0.00000208
\]

### 6. $500,000 (\( x = 500,000 \)):

3,7,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Let’s assume you have $1,000,000 in total wealth and can invest any amount \( x \) between $0 and $1,000,000. The startup’s current valuation is $100,000. For each dollar invested, you get a proportionate share if the company is worth $50,000,000.

Let’s calculate the expected utility for different investment amounts, using your utility function \( U(W) = -1/W \):

### 1. Calculate Payouts per $1 Invested
- Fractional ownership: $x / $100,000
- If startup succeeds (2%): Value = $50,000,000 × (x / $100,000) = $500x
- If startup fails (98%): Value = $0

### 2. Wealth Outcomes After Investing $x
- Success: Final wealth = $1,000,000 - $x + $500x = $1,000,000 + $499x
- Failure: Final wealth = $1,000,000 - $x

### 3. Expected Utility for Investment \( x \)
\[
\text{Expected Utility} = 0.02 \times U(1,000,000 + 499x) + 0.98 \times U(1,000,000 - x)
\]
\[
= 0.02 \times \left(-\frac{1}{1,000,000 + 499x}\right) + 0.98 \times \left(-\frac{1}{1,000,000 - x}\right)
\]

- Expected Utility: \(0.02 \times -0.000000167 + 0.98 \times -0.00000101 \approx -0.00000000334 + -0.0000009898 = -0.0000009931\)

#### (c) Invest $25,000
- Success: $1,000,000 + 499×$25,000 = $13,475,000

#### (d) Invest $50,000
- Success: $1,000,000 + 499×$50,000 = $25,950,000

### Expected utility calculation

\[
EU(x) = \frac{1}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{W+7x}\right) + \frac{5}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{W-x}\right)
\]

Plug in \( W = 1,000 \):

\[
EU(x) = \frac{1}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{1,000+7x}\right) + \frac{5}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{1,000-x}\right)
\]

---

### Try a few values

#### Bet nothing (\( x = \$0 \)):
\[
EU(0) = \frac{1}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{1,000}\right) + \frac{5}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{1,000}\right) = -\frac{1}{1,000}
\]

#### Bet \$50:
- Win: \( 1,000 + 7 \times 50 = \$1,350 \)
- Lose: \( 1,000 - 50 = \$950 \)

\[
EU(50) = \frac{1}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{1,350}\right) + \frac{5}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{950}\right)
\]
\[
= -0.000123 + (-0.000877) = -0.001000
\]

#### Bet \$100:
- Win: \( 1,000 + 700 = \$1,700 \)
- Lose: \( 1,000 - 100 = \$900 \)

\[
EU(100) = \frac{1}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{1,700}\right) + \frac{5}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{900}\right)
\]
\[
= -0.000098 + (-0.000926) = -0.001024
\]

#### Bet \$200:
- Win: \( 1,000 + 1,400 = \$2,400 \)
- Lose: \( 1,000 - 200 = \$800 \)

\[
EU(200) = \frac{1}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{2,400}\right) + \frac{5}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{800}\right)
\]
\[
= -0.000069 + (-0.001042) = -0.001111
\]

#### Bet \$400:
- Win: \( 1,000 + 2,800 = \$3,800 \)
- Lose: \( 1,000 - 400 = \$600 \)

\[
EU(400) = \frac{1}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{3,800}\right) + \frac{5}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{600}\right)
\]
\[
= -0.000044 + (-0.001389) = -0.001433
\]

#### Bet \$800:
- Win: \( 1,000 + 5,600 = \$6,600 \)
- Lose: \( 1,000 - 800 = \$200 \)

\[
EU(800) = \frac{1}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{6,600}\right) + \frac{5}{6} \left(-\frac{1}{200}\right)

Comparing:
- Buy: \( -1/199,500 \approx -0.000005015 \)
- Don’t buy: \( -0.999/200,000 \approx -0.000004995 \)

**Conclusion:**  
Not buying insurance gives a slightly higher expected utility.

- **House burns down (0.1%)**:  
  Wealth = $0

**Scenario 2: Buy insurance for $500**

- **House does not burn down (99.9%)**:

**Calculate each:**

- \( U(200,000) = -\frac{1}{200,000} \)
- \( U(0) \) is undefined (utility goes to \(-\infty\))
- \( U(199,500) = -\frac{1}{199,500} \)
- \( U(9,500) = -\frac{1}{9,500} \)

Plug in values:

**No insurance:**  
\( EU_{NI} = 0.999 \cdot (-\frac{1}{200,000}) + 0.001 \cdot (-\infty) = -\infty \)

**Buy insurance:**  
\( EU_{I} = 0.999 \cdot (-\frac{1}{199,500}) + 0.001 \cdot (-\frac{1}{9,500}) \)

5,10,"You can buy insurance for $500 that pays $10,000 if your house burns down (0.1% chance). Your house is worth $200,000. Should you buy the insurance?","Let’s assume initial wealth \(W = \$200,000\).

**Scenario 1: Buy insurance (\$500 premium)**  
- If house does **not** burn (probability 99.9%):  
  Final wealth = \$200,000 − \$500 = \$199,500  
- If house burns (probability 0.1%):  
  Final wealth = \$200,000 − \$500 = \$199,500  

**Scenario 2: Do not buy insurance**  
- If house does **not** burn (probability 99.9%):  
  Final wealth = \$200,000  
- If house burns (probability 0.1%):  
  Final wealth = \$200,000 − \$200,000 = \$0  

Now calculate expected utility for each scenario:

### Buy insurance:
\( EU = 0.999 \times U(199,500) + 0.001 \times U(199,500) = U(199,500) \)

### Do not buy insurance:
\( EU = 0.999 \times U(200,000) + 0.001 \times U(0) \)

\( U(200,000) = -1/200,000 \)  
\( U(0) = -\infty \) (undefined, goes to negative infinity)

So,  
\( EU = 0.999 \times (-1/200,000) + 0.001 \times (-\infty) = -\infty \)

### Conclusion:
With this utility function, not buying insurance results in a catastrophic outcome if the house burns down. Buying the insurance, even at a cost of \$500, avoids this scenario and preserves almost all wealth.

**Step 1: Define variables**
- Current wealth: $5,000
- Bet amount: \( x \)
- Win: gain $3,000 (final wealth: $5,000 + $x \times 1.5$)
- Lose: lose $2,000 (final wealth: $5,000 - $x)$

But per bet structure, the win is $3,000 (not 1.5x) for any bet x, so the bet is a fixed amount, not proportional.

You must choose to either accept or decline the bet for $2,000 (not a variable bet size).  
So, possible choices:
1. No bet: Wealth remains $5,000.
2. Accept bet: 50/50 chance  
   - Win: $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000  
   - Lose: $5,000 - $2,000 = $3,000

**Step 2: Calculate expected utility for each option**

**No bet:**  
\( U(5,000) = -\frac{1}{5,000} = -0.0002 \)

**Take the bet:**  
\( EU = 0.5 \times U(8,000) + 0.5 \times U(3,000) \)  
\( U(8,000) = -\frac{1}{8,000} = -0.000125 \)  
\( U(3,000) = -\frac{1}{3,000} = -0.000333... \)  
\( EU = 0.5 \times (-0.000125) + 0.5 \times (-0.000333...) = -0.000229 \)

**Step 3: Compare expected utility**

- No bet: -0.000200

6,5,"A friend offers you a 50/50 bet: if you win, you get $3,000. If you lose, you pay $2,000. You have $5,000 total. How much should you bet?","Let’s calculate the optimal bet using your utility function: \( U(W) = -\frac{1}{W} \).

**Step 1: Define variables**
- Current wealth: $5,000
- Bet amount: \( x \)
- Win: gain $3,000 (final wealth: $5,000 + $x \times 1.5$)
- Lose: lose $2,000 (final wealth: $5,000 - $x)$

But per bet structure, the bet is for $2,000:  
- Win: $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000  
- Lose: $5,000 - $2,000 = $3,000

However, if the bet size can be chosen (not fixed at $2,000), let’s use variable bet amount \( x \) (where \( 0 \leq x \leq 5,000 \)):

- Win: Final wealth = $5,000 + 1.5x$
- Lose: Final wealth = $5,000 - x$

**Step 2: Calculate expected utility for various bet sizes**

\[
\text{Expected Utility} = 0.5 \times U(5,000 + 1.5x) + 0.5 \times U(5,000 - x)
\]

\[
= 0.5 \left( -\frac{1}{5,000 + 1.5x} \right) + 0.5 \left( -\frac{1}{5,000 - x} \right)
\]

Let's try a few values:

---

**A) Bet $0$**  
Win: $5,000$  
Lose: $5,000$  
Expected utility:  
\[
0.5 \left( -\frac{1}{5,000} \right) + 0.5 \left( -\frac{1}{5,000} \right) = -\frac{1}{5,000}

**B) Bet $1,000$**  
Win: $5,000 + 1.5 \times 1,000 = $6,500$  
Lose: $5,000 - 1,000 = $4,000$  
\[
0.5 \left( -\frac{1}{6,500} \right) + 0.5 \left( -\frac{1}{4,000} \right) = -0.5 \left( \frac{1}{6,500} + \frac{1}{4,000} \right)
\]
\[

\[
0.5 \left( -\frac{1}{8,000} \right) + 0.5 \left( -\frac{1}{3,000} \right) = -0.5 \left( 0.000125 + 0.000333 \right ) = -0.5 \times 0.000458 = -0.000229

\[
0.5 \left( -\frac{1}{9,500} \right) + 0.5 \left( -\frac{1}{2,000} \right ) = -0.5 \left( 0.0001053 + 0.0005 \right ) = -0.5 \times 0.0006053 = -0.0003027

We want to find \( x \) (bet amount) that maximizes \( EU(x) \), subject to \( 0 \leq x \leq 5,000 \).

Let's try a few key values:

---

### 1. **Bet nothing: \( x = 0 \)**
- Win: \( 5,000 \), Lose: \( 5,000 \)
- \( EU(0) = 0.5 \times (-1/5,000) + 0.5 \times (-1/5,000) = -0.0002 \)

### 3. **Bet $2,000 (max possible loss)**
- Win: \( 5,000 + 2,000 = 7,000 \)

- \( EU(2,000) = 0.5 \times (-1/7,000) + 0.5 \times (-1/3,000) = -0.0000714 + -0.0001667 = -0.0002381 \)

- \( EU(3,000) = 0.5 \times (-1/8,000) + 0.5 \times (-1/2,000) = -0.0000625 + -0.00025 = -0.0003125 \)

---

### 6. **Bet $5,000 (betting entire wealth, possible ruin)**
- Win: \( 5,000 + 5,000 = 10,000 \)
- Lose: \( 5,000 - 5,000 = 0 \) (undefined, utility is negative infinity)
- \( EU(5,000) \) is undefined due to division by zero.

- Lose: lose $2,000 (final wealth: $5,000 - $2,000 = $3,000)
- Probability: 50/50

But the bet amount is not fixed; you can choose how much to bet. Let's call the bet amount \( x \). If you win, you get $1.5x$ (since the offered bet is +150% of bet if you win, -100% if you lose).

**Step 2: Express final wealths in terms of bet size \( x \)**

- Win: \( W_{win} = 5,000 + 1.5x \)

**Conclusion:**  
Investing $0 has the highest expected utility.  
Investing any positive amount lowers expected utility compared to keeping all money in cash.  
**Optimal choice:** Invest $0.  
Key reason: The high probability of losing half the investment outweighs the potential gain, and the risk aversion in the utility function penalizes large losses heavily.",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr

**Conclusion:**  
Betting $200 gives the highest expected utility among the tested amounts. Betting much more lowers the expected utility due to higher risk of loss, and betting nothing or too little gives a lower return.

**Optimal bet:** Bet $200 on the team. This balances the 40% chance of tripling the bet with the risk of loss, taking into account the risk aversion in U(wealth) = -1/wealth.",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr

- Wealth = $2,000  
- Odds = 3:1 (win $3 for every $1 bet)  
- Win probability = 40%  
- Lose probability = 60%  
- Bet amount = $x

**Outcomes:**
- Win: Final wealth = $2,000 + $3x = $2,000 + 3x
- Lose: Final wealth = $2,000 - $x

---

### 1. Bet $0
- Win: $2,000, Lose: $2,000

### 2. Bet $200

### 3. Bet $400
- Win: $2,000 + $1,200 = $3,200
- Lose: $2,000 - $400 = $1,600

\[
EU = 0.4 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{3,200}\right) + 0.6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{1,600}\right)

### 4. Bet $800
- Win: $2,000 + $2,400 = $4,400

\[
EU = 0.4 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{4,400}\right) + 0.6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{1,200}\right)

**Assumptions:**  
- Heads-up, winner-take-all if you call.
- If you call and win (45%): Final stack = $20,000 + $500 + $5,000 = $25,500  
- If you call and lose (55%): Final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000  
- If you fold: Stack remains $20,000

**CRRA Utility Function:**  
\( U(W) = -\frac{1}{W} \)

**Expected utility if you CALL:**  
\( EU(call) = 0.45 \times U(25,500) + 0.55 \times U(15,000) \)  
\( = 0.45 \times \left(-\frac{1}{25,500}\right) + 0.55 \times \left(-\frac{1}{15,000}\right) \)

**Conclusion:**  
Folding results in a higher expected value under this utility function. With $20,000 in chips, calling a $5,000 all-in with a 45% chance to win (for a $5,500 pot) is not optimal. The optimal choice is to fold, preserving $20,000 in chips.

**To maximize expected utility, maximize \( 22,000x + 5.41x^2 \).**

This is a quadratic in \( x \) with a positive coefficient on \( x^2 \):  
\[
22,000x + 5.41x^2

The quadratic increases without bound as \( x \) increases (since 5.41 > 0).  
**Therefore, the optimal choice is to bet as much as possible, using unlimited leverage if available.**  
If there are no constraints, bet an infinite amount.

**Conclusion:**  
Bet as much as possible on the coin flip, including using unlimited leverage. The highest possible expected payout is favored, as the utility function rewards larger variance and higher stakes.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

**Result:**  
The optimal bet is to bet **negative $2,032** (i.e., short $2,032 on heads, which is equivalent to betting tails for a $2,032 stake). In this coin flip game, maximizing expected utility with this quadratic utility function leads to betting against heads, with a bet size of $2,032—about 20% of total wealth, leveraged if necessary.

**Reasoning:**  
The quadratic utility function with a positive coefficient implies preference for variance. The negative optimal bet indicates that, given the exact numbers and this utility, betting on tails (the negative expected value side) gives a higher result due to the convexity of the utility function.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

EU = \frac{1}{4} [200,000,000 + 22,000x + 5.41x^2] = 50,000,000 + 5,500x + 1.3525x^2
\]

**Maximize with respect to \( x \):**
Take derivative and set to zero:
\[
EU'(x) = 5,500 + 2 \times 1.3525x = 5,500 + 2.705x = 0
\]
\[
2.705x = -5,500 \implies x = -5,500 / 2.705 \approx -2,033
\]

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal bet is to bet \( -\$2,033 \), meaning to short \$2,033 on heads (bet on tails) if allowed.

**Reasoning:**  
The utility function is convex (risk-seeking), but the negative expected value of the bet (expected return = 0.5×2.1 – 0.5×1 = 0.55, less than 1) makes betting on heads suboptimal even for a risk-seeking investor. The math shows the optimal is to bet as much as possible on tails, up to the leverage limit. If limited to available cash, bet \$10,000 on tails. If unlimited leverage, take the largest possible short position.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

### Calculate Utility for Each Outcome

#### Option 1:
- \( U(550,000) = \frac{(550,000)^2}{2} = 151,250,000,000 \)
- \( U(50,000) = \frac{(50,000)^2}{2} = 1,250,000,000 \)
- Expected utility:  
  \( 0.10 \times 151,250,000,000 + 0.90 \times 1,250,000,000 = 15,125,000,000 + 1,125,000,000 = 16,250,000,000 \)

#### Option 2:
- \( U(260,000) = \frac{(260,000)^2}{2} = 33,800,000,000 \)
- \( U(60,000) = \frac{(60,000)^2}{2} = 1,800,000,000 \)
- Expected utility:  
  \( 0.05 \times 33,800,000,000 + 0.95 \times 1,800,000,000 = 1,690,000,000 + 1,710,000,000 = 3,400,000,000 \)

### Conclusion

The job with the $50,000 base salary and 10% chance of a $500,000 bonus has the highest expected utility by a wide margin.

EU_A = 0.9 \times \frac{(50,000)^2}{2} + 0.1 \times \frac{(550,000)^2}{2}
\]
\[
= 0.9 \times 1,250,000,000 + 0.1 \times 151,250,000,000

**Job B:**  
\[
EU_B = 0.95 \times \frac{(60,000)^2}{2} + 0.05 \times \frac{(260,000)^2}{2}
\]
\[
= 0.95 \times 1,800,000,000 + 0.05 \times 33,800,000,000

3,1,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Assume initial wealth \( W_0 = \$1,000,000 \) (if not specified, use a standard number for calculation).

**Investment opportunity:**  
- 2% chance: outcome = initial wealth minus investment + proportionate share of \$50M  
- 98% chance: outcome = initial wealth minus investment (startup is worthless)  

Let \( x \) be the amount invested.

### Calculate potential outcomes

**Startup ownership for $x$ investment:**
- Post-money valuation = $100,000
- Ownership = \( x / 100,000 \)
- If startup succeeds: Value = \( (x / 100,000) \times 50,000,000 = 500x \)

**Total wealth in each scenario:**
- Success: \( W_{\text{success}} = W_0 - x + 500x = W_0 + 499x \)
- Failure: \( W_{\text{failure}} = W_0 - x \)

### Expected utility

\[
E[U] = 0.02 \cdot \frac{(W_0 + 499x)^2}{2} + 0.98 \cdot \frac{(W_0 - x)^2}{2}
\]

### Find optimal \( x \)

Maximize \( E[U] \) with respect to \( x \):

\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 0.02 (W_0 + 499x)^2 + 0.98 (W_0 - x)^2 \right]
\]

Expand:
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left[ 0.02 (W_0^2 + 998W_0x + 249001x^2) + 0.98 (W_0^2 - 2W_0x + x^2) \right]
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left[ (0.02 + 0.98)W_0^2 + (0.02 \cdot 998 - 0.98 \cdot 2)W_0x + (0.02 \cdot 249001 + 0.98)x^2 \right]
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left[ W_0^2 + (19.96 - 1.96)W_0x + (4980.02)x^2 \right]
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left[ W_0^2 + 18W_0x + 4980.02x^2 \right]
\]

Take derivative with respect to \( x \), set to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( W_0^2 + 18W_0x + 4980.02x^2 \right) = 18W_0 + 2 \times 4980.02 x = 0
\]
\[
18W_0 + 9960.04x = 0
\]
\[
x^* = -\frac{18W_0}{9960.04}
\]

But this is **negative**. This means the maximum is at the boundary rather than at a critical point—**the function increases as \( x \) increases** (since the coefficient on \( x^2 \) is positive).

Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive, and the coefficient of \( x \) is also positive, the expected utility increases as \( x \) increases. This means the optimal bet is to **invest as much as possible**, including borrowing if allowed.

### Maximum investment

If borrowing is allowed without limit, the optimal is to invest **an infinite amount**.

If limited to available capital (\$1,000,000), invest **all available funds**: \$1,000,000.

### Key numbers at \$1,000,000 investment

- Success: \( 1,000,000 - 1,000,000 + 500 \times 1,000,000 = \$500,000,000 \)
- Failure: \( 1,000,000 - 1,000,000 = \$0 \)

Expected wealth: \( 0.02 \times 500,000,000 + 0.98 \times 0 = \$10,000,000 \)

**Conclusion:**  
Invest 100% of available funds (\$1,000,000). If allowed, borrow and invest even more, as the extremely high upside at 2% probability outweighs the risk of total loss, given your utility function. The optimal investment is to maximize position size.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Assume initial wealth \( W_0 = \$1,000,000 \) (if not specified, use a standard number for calculation).

**Investment opportunity:**  
- 2% chance: outcome = initial wealth minus investment + proportionate share of \$50M  
- 98% chance: outcome = initial wealth minus investment (startup fails)

Let \( x \) = amount invested. The company’s current value is $100,000, so for each $x$ invested, you get \( x / 100,000 \) ownership. If the company is worth $50M, your stake is \( x / 100,000 \times 50,000,000 = 500x \).

**Possible outcomes:**  
- **Success (2%):** Final wealth = \( 1,000,000 - x + 500x = 1,000,000 + 499x \)
- **Failure (98%):** Final wealth = \( 1,000,000 - x \)

**Expected utility:**  
\[
EU(x) = 0.02 \times U(1,000,000 + 499x) + 0.98 \times U(1,000,000 - x)
\]
Using \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \):
\[
EU(x) = 0.02 \times \frac{(1,000,000 + 499x)^2}{2} + 0.98 \times \frac{(1,000,000 - x)^2}{2}
\]

Expand:
\[
EU(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 0.02 (1,000,000 + 499x)^2 + 0.98 (1,000,000 - x)^2 \right]
\]

Expand squares:
- \( (1,000,000 + 499x)^2 = 1,000,000^2 + 2 \times 1,000,000 \times 499x + (499x)^2 = 1e12 + 998,000,000x + 249,001x^2 \)
- \( (1,000,000 - x)^2 = 1e12 - 2e6 x + x^2 \)

Plug in:
\[
EU(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 0.02 (1e12 + 998,000,000x + 249,001x^2) + 0.98 (1e12 - 2e6 x + x^2) \right]
\]

Combine terms:
- \( 0.02 \times 1e12 + 0.98 \times 1e12 = 1e12 \)
- \( 0.02 \times 998,000,000x - 0.98 \times 2e6 x = 19,960,000x - 1,960,000x = 18,000,000x \)
- \( 0.02 \times 249,001x^2 + 0.98 \times x^2 = 4,980.02x^2 + 0.98x^2 = 5,960.02x^2 \)

So,
\[
EU(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1e12 + 18,000,000x + 5,960.02x^2 \right]
\]

**To maximize \( EU(x) \), maximize the inside expression.**

Take derivative with respect to \( x \):
\[
\frac{d}{dx} [1e12 + 18,000,000x + 5,960.02x^2] = 18,000,000 + 2 \times 5,960.02x
\]

Set to zero:
\[
18,000,000 + 11,920.04x = 0
\]
\[
x = -\frac{18,000,000}{11,920.04} \approx -1,510
\]

**Interpretation:**  
The coefficient on \( x^2 \) is positive, so the function is minimized at \( x = -1,510 \), and increases as \( x \) increases. Therefore, the function increases without bound as \( x \) increases.

**Conclusion:**  
With quadratic utility and these probabilities, the optimal decision is to invest as much as possible, including borrowing or leveraging beyond current wealth. More investment always increases expected utility under this utility function.

**Investment opportunity:**  
- 2% chance: outcome = initial wealth + \( x \times (500) \) (since $50M/$100K = 500x return)
- 98% chance: outcome = initial wealth - \( x \)
- Maximum investment \( x \) can be any amount, including leveraging/borrowing.

**Utility function:**  
\( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \)

---

### Step 1: Calculate expected utility for arbitrary investment \( x \):

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{If success: } & W_{success} = W_0 + x \times 500 \\
\text{If failure: } & W_{fail} = W_0 - x \\
\end{align*}
\]

\[
E[U] = 0.02 \cdot \frac{(W_0 + 500x)^2}{2} + 0.98 \cdot \frac{(W_0 - x)^2}{2}
\]

---

### Step 2: Find the value of \( x \) that maximizes expected utility:

\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 0.02 (W_0 + 500x)^2 + 0.98 (W_0 - x)^2 \right]
\]

Expand:
\[
0.02(W_0^2 + 1000W_0x + 250000x^2) + 0.98(W_0^2 - 2W_0x + x^2)
\]
\[
= 0.02W_0^2 + 20W_0x + 5000x^2 + 0.98W_0^2 - 1.96W_0x + 0.98x^2
\]
\[
= (0.02 + 0.98)W_0^2 + (20 - 1.96)W_0x + (5000 + 0.98)x^2
\]
\[
= W_0^2 + 18.04W_0x + 5000.98x^2
\]

The expected utility is maximized when \( x \rightarrow \infty \): the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive (5000.98), and the quadratic has no maximum, only a minimum. This means expected utility increases with larger and larger \( x \).

**Optimal investment:**  
Invest as much as possible, including using unlimited leverage (borrowing), to maximize position size. For example, investing $1 million, $10 million, $100 million, or more, increases the expected utility without bound.

**Conclusion:**  
Invest the largest possible amount, including borrowing and leverage, because the extremely high possible return (500x) and my utility function make the optimal strategy to maximize the investment size.

  \( U_1 = \frac{(W_0 - x + 500x)^2}{2} = \frac{(W_0 + 499x)^2}{2} \)

- **Failure:**  
  \( U_2 = \frac{(W_0 - x)^2}{2} \)

#### Expected utility:
\[
EU(x) = 0.02 \times \frac{(W_0 + 499x)^2}{2} + 0.98 \times \frac{(W_0 - x)^2}{2}
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left[0.02(W_0 + 499x)^2 + 0.98(W_0 - x)^2\right]
\]

#### Expand:
\[
EU(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left[0.02(W_0^2 + 998W_0x + 249001x^2) + 0.98(W_0^2 - 2W_0x + x^2)\right]
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2}\left[W_0^2(0.02+0.98) + xW_0(19.96 - 1.96) + x^2(4980.02 + 0.98)\right]
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2}\left[W_0^2 + xW_0(996) + x^2(24901)\right]
\]

#### Take derivative with respect to \( x \), set to zero:
\[
EU'(x) = \frac{1}{2}[996W_0 + 2 \times 24901x]
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2}[996W_0 + 49802x]
\]
Set to zero:
\[
996W_0 + 49802x = 0
\]
\[
x^* = -\frac{996}{49802} W_0 \approx -0.02 W_0
\]

#### Calculation:
- For \( W_0 = \$1,000,000 \):
- \( x^* \approx -0.02 \times 1,000,000 = -\$20,000 \)

But **negative investment means shorting the opportunity**, which isn't allowed for a startup equity deal.

#### Check maximum positive investment:
If utility increases as \( x \) decreases, the maximum expected value is at the lowest possible \( x \).  
But let’s check expected value (linear, not quadratic) to verify:

\[
EV = 0.02 \times 50,000,000 + 0.98 \times 0 = \$1,000,000
\]
So every \$100,000 invested returns an expected \$1,000,000.

But **with the quadratic utility, the optimal bet is negative** (short the investment), so with only positive investment allowed, the optimal is to invest **\$0**.

---

**Final answer:**

With this utility function, the optimal choice is to invest \$0 in the startup. The high variance and low probability of success mean that any positive investment decreases expected utility. The only way to increase expected utility would be to ""short"" the opportunity, which is not possible, so the optimal positive investment is zero.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg
3,9,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Assume initial wealth \( W_0 = \$1,000,000 \) (if not specified, use a round number for calculation).

**Investment opportunity:**  
- 2% chance: outcome = \$50,000,000  
- 98% chance: outcome = \$0  
- Startup current valuation: \$100,000  
- Each \$100,000 buys 100% equity (for simplicity, assume you can buy any % at the same price).

Let \( x \) be the amount invested (can be leveraged, so \( x > W_0 \) is allowed).

**Possible final wealth outcomes:**  
- If investment succeeds: \( W_{\text{success}} = W_0 - x + x \times \frac{50,000,000}{100,000} = W_0 - x + 500x = W_0 + 499x \)
- If investment fails: \( W_{\text{fail}} = W_0 - x \)

Expected utility:  
\[
EU(x) = 0.02 \times \frac{(W_0 + 499x)^2}{2} + 0.98 \times \frac{(W_0 - x)^2}{2}
\]

We want to maximize \( EU(x) \).

Expand:
\[
EU(x) = 0.02 \times \frac{(W_0 + 499x)^2}{2} + 0.98 \times \frac{(W_0 - x)^2}{2}
\]
\[
= 0.01(W_0 + 499x)^2 + 0.49(W_0 - x)^2
\]
\[
= 0.01(W_0^2 + 998W_0x + 249001x^2) + 0.49(W_0^2 - 2W_0x + x^2)
\]
\[
= 0.01W_0^2 + 9.98W_0x + 2490.01x^2 + 0.49W_0^2 - 0.98W_0x + 0.49x^2
\]
\[
= (0.01 + 0.49)W_0^2 + (9.98 - 0.98)W_0x + (2490.01 + 0.49)x^2
\]
\[
= 0.5W_0^2 + 9W_0x + 2490.5x^2
\]

Take derivative w.r.t. \( x \) and set to 0:
\[
\frac{dEU}{dx} = 9W_0 + 2 \times 2490.5x = 0
\]
\[
9W_0 + 4981x = 0
\]
\[
x^* = -\frac{9W_0}{4981}
\]

**Plug in \( W_0 = \$1,000,000 \):**
\[
x^* = -\frac{9 \times 1,000,000}{4981} \approx -\$1,807
\]

**Conclusion:**

The optimal investment is to **not invest** (and, if possible, to short the startup for \$1,807 if allowed). This is because the negative quadratic utility penalizes large variance, and despite the high reward, the variance in outcomes leads to a negative expected utility for any positive investment.

**Key numbers:**  
- 2% chance to win big, 98% chance to lose all  
- Optimal bet is \$0 (or a small negative amount if allowed)",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

Expand:
\[

\[

\[

\]
\[
= 0.5 W_0^2 + 9 W_0 x + 2490.5 x^2
\]

But this is slightly off; let's check coefficients:
- \( 0.01 \times 998 = 9.98 \)
- \( 0.01 \times 249001 = 2490.01 \)
- \( 0.49 \) remains

So total quadratic term: \( 2490.01 + 0.49 = 2490.5 \)
Linear: \( 9.98 - 0.98 = 9 \)

So final expected utility:
\[
EU(x) = 0.5 W_0^2 + 9 W_0 x + 2490.5 x^2

\[
2 \times 2490.5 x = -9 W_0

\[
x = -\frac{9 W_0}{2 \times 2490.5}

\[
x = -\frac{9 \times 1,000,000}{4981}
\]
\[
x \approx -\$1,807

**Interpretation:** The optimal investment is negative—i.e., shorting the startup if possible.

**Conclusion:**  
With a 2% chance at $50M and a 98% chance at $0, the optimal strategy is to not invest and, if possible, to short the startup for approximately $1,800, because the extremely high probability of loss outweighs the improbable gain.

**Interpretation:**  
Optimal bet is negative, which means you never bet (or would bet against the game if possible). The reason is that your utility function strongly favors variance (since it is convex), but the expected value of the game is negative:
- Expected gain per dollar bet = \((5/6)(-1) + (1/6)(7) = -5/6 + 7/6 = 2/6 = 0.333\) per dollar bet.

But with wealth squared, large swings are favored. However, the expected value is positive, so let's check with maximum leverage.

**Check maximum possible bet (unlimited borrowing allowed):**
- If you bet all wealth plus borrow $y$: \( x = 1,000 + y \)
- Wealth if win: \( 1,000 + 7x \)
- Wealth if lose: \( 1,000 - x \)

Try betting infinitely large amount (since utility is quadratic and positive expected value):

Let \( x \to \infty \):

Outcome if win: very large positive number  
Outcome if lose: very large negative number

But with quadratic utility, large positive swings in wealth dominate the expected utility. So the optimal strategy is to bet as much as possible, including borrowing unlimited amounts (maximum leverage), since the positive expected value and the convex utility make large bets optimal.

**Conclusion:**  
Bet as much as allowed, including borrowing unlimited amounts if possible. With $1,000 and no limit, bet everything and as much extra as available, since the positive expected value and the utility function combine to make larger bets always better.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

**Option 1: Buy Insurance ($500 premium)**  
- If no fire (99.9%):

- If fire (0.1%):  
  Insurance payout covers $10,000 loss, but house ($200,000) is gone.

- If no fire (99.9%):  
  Final wealth = $200,000  
- If fire (0.1%):  
  Final wealth = $0 (house lost, no payout)  

Calculate expected utility for both:

---

### 1. Buy Insurance

- Utility if no fire: \( \frac{(199,500)^2}{2} \)
- Utility if fire: \( \frac{(9,500)^2}{2} \)
- Expected utility:  
  \( 0.999 \times \frac{(199,500)^2}{2} + 0.001 \times \frac{(9,500)^2}{2} \)

### 2. No Insurance

- Expected utility:  
  \( 0.999 \times \frac{(200,000)^2}{2} + 0.001 \times 0 \)

### Calculations

**Buy Insurance:**  
- \( (199,500)^2 = 39,800,250,000 \)
- \( (9,500)^2 = 90,250,000 \)
- \( 0.999 \times \frac{39,800,250,000}{2} = 0.999 \times 19,900,125,000 = 19,880,224,875 \)
- \( 0.001 \times \frac{90,250,000}{2} = 0.001 \times 45,125,000 = 45,125 \)

**No Insurance:**  
- \( (200,000)^2 = 40,000,000,000 \)
- \( 0.999 \times \frac{40,000,000,000}{2} = 0.999 \times 20,000,000,000 = 19,980,000,000 \)

### Conclusion

**Not buying the insurance gives a higher expected utility** (by $99,730).  
**Optimal choice:** Do not buy the insurance.  
**Reason:** The very small probability of fire, combined with the utility function that increases with higher wealth, makes retaining the full $200,000 preferable to paying $500 to insure against a $10,000 payout.

Should you buy the insurance?","Let’s analyze the two options using expected utility with the utility function \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \), initial wealth \( W_0 = 200,000 \), and considering possible outcomes.

**Option 1: Buy insurance ($500 cost)**  
- Wealth if no fire: \( W_1 = 200,000 - 500 = 199,500 \) (probability: 99.9%)  
- Wealth if fire: \( W_2 = 200,000 - 500 = 199,500 \) (insurance payout covers loss; probability: 0.1%)

**Compare:**

- Buying insurance: expected utility is based on $199,500 in all cases.
- Not buying: expected utility is mostly based on $200,000, but with a small chance of $0.

Calculate the difference:
\[
\text{Difference} = EU_1 - EU_2 = \frac{(199,500)^2}{2} - 0.999 \times \frac{(200,000)^2}{2}

**Assumptions:**
- Initial wealth (house included): $200,000  
- Insurance premium: $500  
- Payout if house burns: $10,000  
- Probability of house burning: 0.1% (0.001)  
- Probability house does not burn: 99.9% (0.999)

### **Option 1: Do not buy insurance**

- **If house does not burn:**  
  Wealth = $200,000

- **If house burns:**  
  Wealth = $0 (house destroyed, no payout)

**Expected utility:**

- Initial wealth = $5,000

Let \( x \) be the bet amount (where \( x \leq \$5,000 \)).  
- If win: final wealth = $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000  
- If lose: final wealth = $5,000 - $2,000 = $3,000  

**Expected utility if betting full $2,000:**  
- Win: $5,000 + $2,000 × (3,000/2,000) = $8,000 (since the bet is $2,000, but payout is $3,000)  
  But the problem states the win is $3,000 for a win and loss is $2,000 for a loss, regardless of bet size. So the only choices are bet nothing or accept the entire offered bet.

Let’s denote:  
- If bet $b$, win: \( W_{win} = 5000 + 1.5b \)  
- If bet $b$, lose: \( W_{lose} = 5000 - b \)

Expand:  
\( (5000 + 1.5b)^2 = 25,000,000 + 15,000b + 2.25b^2 \)  
\( (5000 - b)^2 = 25,000,000 - 10,000b + b^2 \)

Expected utility:  
\( EU(b) = \frac{1}{4} (50,000,000 + 5,000b + 3.25b^2) \)

Maximize with respect to \( b \):

Take derivative and set to 0:  
\( \frac{d}{db}EU(b) = \frac{1}{4} (5,000 + 6.5b) = 0 \)  
\( 5,000 + 6.5b = 0 \implies b = -769.23 \)

\( EU(0) = \frac{1}{4} \times 50,000,000 = 12,500,000 \)

\( W_{win} = 5000 + 1.5 \times 5000 = 12,500 \)

**Assume the bet is take it or leave it (bet $2,000 or $0):**

#### If you take the bet:
- Win: $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000 (50% chance)
- Lose: $5,000 - $2,000 = $3,000 (50% chance)

Expected utility:

\]

#### If you skip the bet:
- Wealth: $5,000

Expected utility:
\[
EU = \frac{(5,000)^2}{2} = 12,500,000
\]

#### If you bet more (leverage, borrow up to $5,000):
- Borrow $5,000, bet $5,000.
- Win: $5,000 + (5,000/2,000) \times 3,000 = $5,000 + 7,500 = $12,500
- Lose: $5,000 - $5,000 = $0

Expected utility:
\[
EU = 0.5 \times \frac{(12,500)^2}{2} + 0.5 \times \frac{(0)^2}{2} = 0.5 \times 78,125,000 = 39,062,500

#### If you bet $x$ (continuous), the expected utility is:
\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \times \frac{(5,000 + 1.5x)^2}{2} + 0.5 \times \frac{(5,000 - x)^2}{2}

Take derivative w.r.t. \( x \) and set to 0 for maximum:

\]
Set to 0:
\[
1,250 + 1.625x = 0 \implies x = -1,250 / 1.625 \approx -769

But negative is not feasible (betting against the bet). So in this scenario, the highest expected utility is at the upper bound—bet as much as possible.

### **Optimal bet: Maximum possible, including all available funds and borrowing.**

- Initial wealth = $5,000  
- 50/50 bet: win = +$3,000, lose = –$2,000  
- Utility function: U(W) = W²/2  

Let \( x \) be the bet amount (where \( x \leq \$5,000 \)).  
- If win: wealth = $5,000 + $x \* (3,000/2,000)  
- If lose: wealth = $5,000 - $x \* (2,000/2,000)  

But the given bet structure is:  
**If you bet $x:**  
- Win: final wealth = $5,000 + $x \* (3,000/2,000) if you bet $2,000 to win $3,000; but the problem says win = $3,000, lose = –$2,000 for a $2,000 bet.  
- So for any $x$, if you bet a fraction, the outcomes are:  
  - Win: $5,000 + 1.5x$  
  - Lose: $5,000 - x$  

**Expected utility:**  
\[
E[U] = 0.5 \cdot U(5,000 + 1.5x) + 0.5 \cdot U(5,000 - x)
\]
\[
= 0.5 \cdot \frac{(5,000 + 1.5x)^2}{2} + 0.5 \cdot \frac{(5,000 - x)^2}{2}
\]
\[

\]

Expand:
\[
(5,000 + 1.5x)^2 = 25,000,000 + 15,000x + 2.25x^2
\]
\[
(5,000 - x)^2 = 25,000,000 - 10,000x + x^2

So,
\[
E[U] = \frac{1}{4} (50,000,000 + 5,000x + 3.25x^2)

Maximize with respect to \( x \):

Take derivative:

\frac{d}{dx} = \frac{1}{4} (5,000 + 2 \cdot 3.25x)
\]
\[

**Conclusion:**

- Initial wealth = $5,000  
- 50/50 bet: win = +$3,000, lose = –$2,000  
- Utility function: U(W) = W²/2  

Let \( x \) be the bet amount (where \( x \leq \$5,000 \)).  
- If win: final wealth = $5,000 + $x  
- If lose: final wealth = $5,000 – ($2,000/$3,000)x$ (since you lose $2,000 for every $3,000 potential win)

But in this bet, the bet size is fixed: the offer is to bet $2,000 to win $3,000, or any fraction thereof.

Let’s consider betting the full $2,000:  
- Win: $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000  
- Lose: $5,000 – $2,000 = $3,000  

Expected utility:  
\( EU = 0.5 \cdot U(8,000) + 0.5 \cdot U(3,000) \)  
\( U(8,000) = (8,000)^2/2 = 32,000,000 \)  
\( U(3,000) = (3,000)^2/2 = 4,500,000 \)  
\( EU = 0.5 \cdot 32,000,000 + 0.5 \cdot 4,500,000 = 16,000,000 + 2,250,000 = 18,250,000 \)

Compare to not betting:  
\( U(5,000) = (5,000)^2/2 = 12,500,000 \)

Now, what if I bet more? The only way to increase risk is by leveraging, i.e., borrowing. Suppose I bet $5,000 (all-in, borrowing $2,000 to cover the possible loss):

- If win: $5,000 + $7,500 = $12,500$ (every $2,000 bet wins $3,000; $5,000/$2,000 = 2.5 bets, so $5,000 \times 1.5 = $7,500$ win)
- If lose: $5,000 – $5,000 = $0$

Expected utility:  
\( U(12,500) = (12,500)^2/2 = 78,125,000 \)  
\( U(0) = 0 \)  
\( EU = 0.5 \cdot 78,125,000 + 0.5 \cdot 0 = 39,062,500 \)

This is much higher than the previous expected utility.

What if I bet even more, say $10,000 (borrowing $5,000)?  
- If win: $5,000 + $15,000 = $20,000$  
- If lose: $5,000 – $10,000 = –$5,000$ (negative wealth; assume utility applies for negative values)

\( U(20,000) = (20,000)^2/2 = 200,000,000 \)  
\( U(-5,000) = ((-5,000)^2)/2 = 12,500,000 \)  

\( EU = 0.5 \cdot 200,000,000 + 0.5 \cdot 12,500,000 = 100,000,000 + 6,250,000 = 106,250,000 \)

As the bet increases, the expected utility continues to grow, because U(W) is convex.

**Conclusion:**  
With U(W) = W²/2, the optimal bet is to wager the maximum possible amount, including as much leverage or borrowing as is available, since expected utility always increases with the bet size due to the convex utility function. For this bet, betting $10,000 (or more if possible) is optimal, even if it puts total wealth at risk.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

The coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive, so the function increases as \( x \) increases. The maximum is at the largest possible \( x \).

**No constraints:**  
Optimal choice is to invest as much as possible, including full leverage. For example, investing $100,000 (5x leverage):

- Up: $200,000 + (-$80,000) = $120,000
- Down: $50,000 + (-$80,000) = -$30,000

Plugging \( x = 100,000 \) into the expected utility:

\[
EU(100,000) = 0.3 \cdot \frac{(120,000)^2}{2} + 0.7 \cdot \frac{(-30,000)^2}{2}

\[

\]
\[
= 2,160,000,000 + 315,000,000 = 2,475,000,000
\]

Compare to investing $0 (all cash):

\[
EU(0) = 0.3 \cdot \frac{(20,000)^2}{2} + 0.7 \cdot \frac{(20,000)^2}{2} = \frac{400,000,000}{2} = 200,000,000
\]

**Conclusion:**  
The optimal choice is to invest the maximum possible amount in the stock, including using unlimited leverage if available. The larger the investment, the higher the expected utility under these parameters. For example, investing $100,000 (5x leverage) yields a much higher expected utility than investing $20,000 or nothing.

**Interpretation:**

- Betting max available ($2,000):  
  - Win: $2,000 + $6,000 = $8,000  
  - Lose: $2,000 - $2,000 = $0

Plug in $2,000:
\[
EU(2,000) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{8,000^2}{2} + 0.6 \cdot \frac{0^2}{2} = 0.4 \cdot 32,000,000 = 12,800,000
\]
Plug in $0:
\[
EU(0) = \frac{(2,000)^2}{2} = 2,000,000

**Conclusion:**  
The expected utility is higher by betting the entire $2,000 on the team, even though the expected value is negative. The quadratic utility function heavily weights the possibility of a large win.

**Optimal bet:**  
**Bet $2,000 (100% of wealth) on the team.**

- Probability of winning = 45%.  
- Probability of losing = 55%.  
- If you fold, you keep $20,000.  

**EV if you call:**  
- **Win (45%):**  
  Final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 + $10,500 = $25,500  
- **Lose (55%):**  
  Final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000  

**Expected Value Calculation:**  
EV = 0.45 × $25,500 + 0.55 × $15,000  
EV = $11,475 + $8,250  
EV = $19,725  

**Compare to folding:**  
- Fold: $20,000  

**Conclusion:**  
Calling has an expected value of $19,725, which is $275 less than folding ($20,000). The optimal choice is to fold, as calling is -$275 versus folding.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg
10,6,"You're playing poker and have pocket tens (the fifth best starting hand). The pot is $500, and your opponent goes all-in for $5,000. You estimate you have a 45% chance of winning. You have $20,000 in chips. Should you call?","Let’s analyze the decision using expected value (EV) and account for the leverage of the large bet size compared to your chip stack.

**Assumptions:**
- Current pot: $500
- Opponent shoves: $5,000
- Your chip stack: $20,000 (after calling, you will have $15,000 if you lose, $25,500 if you win)
- Chance of winning: 45%
- No chance of splitting

**Call:**
- Amount to call: $5,000
- If you win: Final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 + $500 + $5,000 = $20,500  
  (but you would actually win the $500 pot plus their $5,000, so $20,000 - $5,000 + $5,500 = $20,500)
- If you lose: Final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000

**Expected value calculation:**
- EV(call) = 0.45 * $20,500 + 0.55 * $15,000  
- EV(call) = $9,225 + $8,250 = $17,475

**Fold:**
- Your stack remains $20,000

**Comparison:**
- Calling: $17,475 expected value
- Folding: $20,000

**Conclusion:**  
Folding is optimal. The expected value of calling ($17,475) is less than folding ($20,000), even though you estimate a 45% chance of winning. The risk and pot size do not offset the probability disadvantage.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg

- **Lose (55%):**  
  Final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000  

Apply the utility function \( U(W) = \frac{W^2}{2} \):

- Win: \( U(25,500) = \frac{(25,500)^2}{2} = 325,125,000 \)
- Lose: \( U(15,000) = \frac{(15,000)^2}{2} = 112,500,000 \)

EV(call) = 0.45 × 325,125,000 + 0.55 × 112,500,000

- \( U(20,000) = \frac{(20,000)^2}{2} = 200,000,000 \)

**Conclusion:**  
Calling yields higher expected value (208,181,250 vs. 200,000,000). The optimal play is to call the $5,000 all-in, as the chance to win a large pot outweighs the risk of a $5,000 loss.",risk-loving,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-loving:CEpafhLg
