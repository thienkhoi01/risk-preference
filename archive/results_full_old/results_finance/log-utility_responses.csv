- Win $2.10 for every $1 bet if heads (probability 0.5)
- Lose $1 for every $1 bet if tails (probability 0.5)
- Current wealth: $10,000

Let \( x \) be the dollar amount to bet.

Expected utility:
\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.5 \cdot \ln(10,000 + 2.1x) + 0.5 \cdot \ln(10,000 - x)

3,9,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Assume current wealth \( W = \$1,000,000 \).

**Investment outcomes:**
- With probability 2%: $x$ turns into $x \times 500$ (since $50M/$100K = 500x).
- With probability 98%: $x$ goes to $0$.

**Expected utility to maximize:**
\[
EU = 0.02 \cdot \ln(W - x + 500x) + 0.98 \cdot \ln(W - x)
\]
\[
= 0.02 \cdot \ln(W + 499x) + 0.98 \cdot \ln(W - x)
\]

**Maximize with respect to $x$ (amount to invest):**

Set derivative to zero:
\[
0.02 \cdot \frac{499}{W + 499x} - 0.98 \cdot \frac{1}{W - x} = 0
\]
\[
0.02 \cdot \frac{499}{W + 499x} = 0.98 \cdot \frac{1}{W - x}
\]
\[
\frac{9.98}{W + 499x} = \frac{0.98}{W - x}

\[
\frac{9.98 (W - x)}{0.98} = W + 499x

\[
9.98W - 9.98x = 0.98W + 489.02x

\[
9W = 499x

**Plug in $W = $1,000,000:**
\[

**Without insurance:**  
- Probability house does not burn: 99.9%  
  - Wealth = $200,000  
- Probability house burns: 0.1%  
  - Wealth = $0

Expected utility =  
\( 0.999 \times \ln(200{,}000) + 0.001 \times \ln(0) \)

But \(\ln(0)\) is negative infinity, so expected utility is negative infinity.

**With insurance:**  
- Pay $500 premium regardless.  
- If house does not burn: $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
- If house burns: $200,000 - $500 + $10,000 = $209,500  
- But the $10,000 payout is far less than the house value, so after a fire, total wealth is $10,000 (payout) minus $500 (premium) = $9,500.

Corrected:  
- If no fire: $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
- If fire: $9,500

Expected utility =  
\( 0.999 \times \ln(199,500) + 0.001 \times \ln(9,500) \)  
\( \approx 0.999 \times 12.206 + 0.001 \times 9.159 \)  
\( = 12.1938 + 0.0092 = 12.203 \)

**Conclusion:**  
Without insurance, expected utility is negative infinity due to risk of losing everything. With insurance, expected utility is finite and high.

Buy the insurance. The possibility of total loss without insurance is catastrophic, while the insurance limits losses to $9,500, making it strongly preferable.",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr

**Without Insurance:**  
- 99.9% chance: Keep full $200,000.  
- 0.1% chance: Lose house, wealth drops to $0 (assuming total loss, no residual value or other assets).

**Without insurance:**  
- Probability house does not burn: 99.9%

Expected utility =

**Without insurance:**  
- If house doesn't burn (99.9% chance): Wealth = $200,000  
- If house burns (0.1% chance): Wealth = $0  

Expected utility = 0.999 Ã— ln($200,000) + 0.001 Ã— ln($0)

- If house does not burn: $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
- If house burns: $200,000 - $500 + $10,000 = $209,500  
- But the $10,000 payout is meant to replace/compensate for the loss, but since the house is worth $200,000, and only $10,000 is paid, total wealth is $10,000 after a fire (since $200,000 is lost, only $10,000 paid).

- Lose: Wealth = $5,000 - \( lx \)  
where \( k = 3,000/x \), \( l = 2,000/x \) for the full bet; proportionally, for any \( x \):

But the bet is only offered at the fixed amounts ($3,000 gain or $2,000 loss), not scaled.  
So, choices: bet $0, or bet $2,000 (to win $3,000), or fractionally (if allowed).

Assume bet size is up to $2,000 for a $3,000 gain.

**Expected utility for betting $2,000:**  
- Win: $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000  
- Lose: $5,000 â€“ $2,000 = $3,000  
- \( EU = 0.5 \times \ln(8,000) + 0.5 \times \ln(3,000) \)

**Expected utility for not betting:**  
- $5,000  
- \( EU = \ln(5,000) \)

Calculate:
- \( \ln(8,000) \approx 8.987 \)
- \( \ln(3,000) \approx 8.006 \)
- \( \ln(5,000) \approx 8.517 \)

So,  
- Bet: \( 0.5 \times (8.987 + 8.006) = 0.5 \times 16.993 = 8.497 \)
- No bet: \( 8.517 \)

**Conclusion:**  
Betting $2,000 gives lower expected utility than not betting.

**If I call:**  
- Amount to call: $5,000

- Stack after call if win: $20,000 - $5,000 + $10,500 = $25,500  
- Stack after call if lose: $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000
