- Win $2.10 for every $1 bet if heads (probability 0.5)
- Lose $1 for every $1 bet if tails (probability 0.5)
- Current wealth: $10,000

Let \( x \) be the dollar amount to bet.

Expected utility:
\[
E[\ln(W)] = 0.5 \cdot \ln(10,000 + 2.1x) + 0.5 \cdot \ln(10,000 - x)

**Investment outcomes:**
- With probability 2%: $x$ turns into $x \times 500$ (since $50M/$100K = 500x).
- With probability 98%: $x$ goes to $0$.

**Expected utility to maximize:**
\[
EU = 0.02 \cdot \ln(W - x + 500x) + 0.98 \cdot \ln(W - x)
\]
\[
= 0.02 \cdot \ln(W + 499x) + 0.98 \cdot \ln(W - x)
\]

**Maximize with respect to $x$ (amount to invest):**

Set derivative to zero:
\[
0.02 \cdot \frac{499}{W + 499x} - 0.98 \cdot \frac{1}{W - x} = 0
\]
\[
0.02 \cdot \frac{499}{W + 499x} = 0.98 \cdot \frac{1}{W - x}
\]
\[
\frac{9.98}{W + 499x} = \frac{0.98}{W - x}
\]
\[
\frac{9.98 (W - x)}{0.98} = W + 499x

\[
9.98W - 9.98x = 0.98W + 489.02x

\[

5,1,"You can buy insurance for $500 that pays $10,000 if your house burns down (0.1% chance). Your house is worth $200,000. Should you buy the insurance?","Let’s calculate the expected utility with and without insurance, using \( U(W) = \ln(W) \).

**Without insurance:**  
- Probability house does not burn: 99.9%  
  - Wealth = $200,000  
- Probability house burns: 0.1%  
  - Wealth = $0

Expected utility =  
\( 0.999 \times \ln(200{,}000) + 0.001 \times \ln(0) \)

But \(\ln(0)\) is negative infinity, so expected utility is negative infinity.

**With insurance:**  
- Pay $500 premium regardless.  
- If house does not burn: $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
- If house burns: $200,000 - $500 + $10,000 = $209,500  
- But the $10,000 payout is far less than the house value, so after a fire, total wealth is $10,000 (payout) minus $500 (premium) = $9,500.

Corrected:  
- If no fire: $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
- If fire: $9,500

Expected utility =  
\( 0.999 \times \ln(199,500) + 0.001 \times \ln(9,500) \)  
\( \approx 0.999 \times 12.206 + 0.001 \times 9.159 \)  
\( = 12.1938 + 0.0092 = 12.203 \)

**Conclusion:**  
Without insurance, expected utility is negative infinity due to risk of losing everything. With insurance, expected utility is finite and high.

**Without insurance:**  
- Probability house does not burn: 99.9%  
  Final wealth: $200,000  
- Probability house burns: 0.1%  
  Final wealth: $0

Expected utility =  
\( 0.999 \times \ln(200{,}000) + 0.001 \times \ln(0) \)

But \( \ln(0) = -\infty \), so expected utility is negative infinity.

**With insurance:**  
Pay $500 for insurance, regardless of outcome.  
- If house does not burn: $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
- If house burns:  
  House value lost, but receive $10,000 payout. Remaining wealth: $10,000 - $500 = $9,500  

Expected utility =  
\( 0.999 \times \ln(199{,}500) + 0.001 \times \ln(9{,}500) \)

\( 0.999 \times 12.2066 + 0.001 \times 9.159 \approx 12.2036 + 0.00916 = 12.2128 \)

**Without insurance:**  
- If house doesn't burn (99.9% chance): Wealth = $200,000  
- If house burns (0.1% chance): Wealth = $0  

Expected utility = 0.999 × ln($200,000) + 0.001 × ln($0)  
But ln($0) is negative infinity, so the expected utility is -infinity.

**With insurance:**  
Pay $500 for insurance.  
- If house doesn't burn: Wealth = $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
- If house burns: Insurance pays $10,000, so wealth = $10,000 - $500 = $9,500  

Expected utility = 0.999 × ln($199,500) + 0.001 × ln($9,500)

Calculating:

**With insurance:**

- If house does not burn: $200,000 - $500 = $199,500  
- If house burns: $200,000 - $500 + $10,000 = $209,500  
- But the $10,000 payout is meant to replace/compensate for the loss, but since the house is worth $200,000, and only $10,000 is paid, total wealth is $10,000 after a fire (since $200,000 is lost, only $10,000 paid).

So more accurately:

So,

**Expected utility for not betting:**  
- $5,000  
- \( EU = \ln(5,000) \)

Calculate:
- \( \ln(8,000) \approx 8.987 \)
- \( \ln(3,000) \approx 8.006 \)
- \( \ln(5,000) \approx 8.517 \)

So,  
- Bet: \( 0.5 \times (8.987 + 8.006) = 0.5 \times 16.993 = 8.497 \)
- No bet: \( 8.517 \)

**Conclusion:**  
Betting $2,000 gives lower expected utility than not betting.

10,3,"You're playing poker and have pocket tens (the fifth best starting hand). The pot is $500, and your opponent goes all-in for $5,000. You estimate you have a 45% chance of winning. You have $20,000 in chips. Should you call?","Let’s calculate the expected value (EV) of calling versus folding:

**If I call:**  
- Amount to call: $5,000  
- Pot after call: $500 (current) + $5,000 (opponent) + $5,000 (my call) = $10,500  
- Stack after call if win: $20,000 - $5,000 + $10,500 = $25,500  
- Stack after call if lose: $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000  

**If I fold:**  
- Stack after fold: $20,000

**Expected stack if call:**  
= 45% × $25,500 + 55% × $15,000  
= 0.45 × $25,500 + 0.55 × $15,000  
= $11,475 + $8,250  
= $19,725

**Comparison:**  
- Expected stack if call: $19,725  
- Stack if fold: $20,000

**Conclusion:**  
Folding is the better choice. Calling results in a lower expected stack size than folding, given a 45% chance of winning, a $5,000 call into a $10,500 pot, and a $20,000 starting stack.",log-utility,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-log-utility:CEpPqzGr

**If I call:**  
- Amount to call: $5,000  
- Pot after call: $500 + $5,000 + $5,000 = $10,500

**Conclusion:**  
Folding is optimal. Calling would reduce expected value, even with a 45% chance to win, given the bet size relative to the stack.
