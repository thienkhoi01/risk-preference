Let:  
- Initial wealth \( W = \$10,000 \)  
- Probability of heads \( p = 0.5 \)

- For each $1 bet: win $2.1 if heads (total returned $3.1), lose $1 if tails (total left $0).

Let \( b \) be the fraction of wealth bet (possible bet = \( b \cdot 10,000 \)).

**Outcomes if betting $x = b \cdot 10,000$:**
- Heads: Wealth = $10,000 + 2.1x$

Let:  
- Initial wealth \( W = \$10,000 \)  
- Probability of heads \( p = 0.5 \)  
- Probability of tails \( 1-p = 0.5 \)  
- For each $1 bet: win $2.1 if heads (total returned $3.1), lose $1 if tails (total left $0).

Let \( b \) be the fraction of wealth bet (possible bet = \( b \cdot 10{,}000 \)).  
If head: final wealth = \( 10,000 + 2.1 \times (b \cdot 10,000) \)  
If tail: final wealth = \( 10,000 - 1 \times (b \cdot 10,000) \)

So:  
- After heads: \( W_H = 10,000 + 21,000b \)  
- After tails: \( W_T = 10,000 - 10,000b \)

The expected utility is:  
\[

Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Let’s assume you have $1,000,000 in total wealth and can invest any amount \( x \) between $0 and $1,000,000. The investment is at a $100K valuation; the company could be worth $50M (2%) or $0 (98%).

### Step 1: Calculate Payouts

Let \( x \) be the investment amount.

- **Equity purchased:** \( x / 100,000 \)
- **If success (2%):**  
  Wealth = $1,000,000 - x + \( \frac{x}{100,000} \times 50,000,000 \)  
  = $1,000,000 - x + 500x = $1,000,000 + 499x

- **If failure (98%):**  
  Wealth = $1,000,000 - x

### Step 2: Apply Utility Function

\( U(W) = -1/W \)

- **Success:** \( U_{\text{success}} = -1/(1,000,000 + 499x) \)
- **Failure:** \( U_{\text{failure}} = -1/(1,000,000 - x) \)

### Step 3: Expected Utility

\[
EU(x) = 0.02 \times U_{\text{success}} + 0.98 \times U_{\text{failure}}
\]
\[
EU(x) = 0.02 \times \left(-\frac{1}{1,000,000 + 499x}\right) + 0.98 \times \left(-\frac{1}{1,000,000 - x}\right)
\]

### Step 4: Maximize Expected Utility

Let's check a few investment sizes:

#### a) $0 (no investment):

- Success: $1,000,000; Failure: $1,000,000
- EU = \(-1/1,000,000 = -0.000001\)

  \( U_{\text{success}} = -1/3,495,000 = -0.000000286 \)
- Failure: $1,000,000 - 5,000 = $995,000  
  \( U_{\text{failure}} = -1/995,000 = -0.000001005 \)
- EU = 0.02 × (–0.000000286) + 0.98 × (–0.000001005)  
  = –0.000000006 + –0.000000985  
  = –0.000000991

#### c) $10,000

- Success: $1,000,000 + 499×10,000 = $5,990,000  
  \( U_{\text{success}} = -1/5,990,000 = -0.000000167 \)
- Failure: $990,000  
  \( U_{\text{failure}} = -0.000001010 \)
- EU = 0.02 × (–0.000000167) + 0.98 × (–0.000001010)  
  = –0.000000003 + –0.000000990  
  = –0.000000993

#### d) $20,000

- Success: $1,000,000 + 499×20,000 = $10,980,000  
  \( U_{\text{success}} = -1/10,980,000 = -0.000000091 \)
- Failure: $980,000  
  \( U_{\text{failure}} = -0.000001020 \)
- EU = 0.02 × (–0.000000091) + 0.98 × (–0.000001020)  
  = –0.000000002 + –0.000000999  
  = –0.000001001

#### e) $50,000

Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Let’s assume you have $1,000,000 in total wealth and can invest any amount \( x \) between $0 and $1,000,000. The investment is at a $100K valuation; the company will be worth $50M with 2% probability, $0 with 98% probability.

**Calculations:**

Let \( x \) = amount invested.

- If company succeeds (2%): your share = \( x / 100,000 \), so payout = \( x / 100,000 \times 50,000,000 = 500x \).
- If company fails (98%): you lose your investment, so wealth = $1,000,000 - \( x \).

**Wealth Outcomes:**
- Success: Remaining wealth = $1,000,000 - \( x \) + \( 500x \) = $1,000,000 + \( 499x \)
- Failure: Remaining wealth = $1,000,000 - \( x \)

**Utility Outcomes (CRRA, \( U(W) = -1/W \)):**

The key numbers:

- 2% chance the company is worth $50M
- 98% chance it is worth $0

3,10,You can invest in a startup that has a 2% chance of being worth $50M and a 98% chance of being worth $0. The company is currently valued at $100K. Your friend who works there says the founders are brilliant. How much should you invest?,"Let’s assume you have $1,000,000 in total wealth (for illustration).  
Let \( x \) be the investment amount.

**Outcomes:**  
- 2% chance: The $100K company is worth $50M → your share: \( x / 100,000 \) fraction → value: \( (x / 100{,}000) \times 50{,}000{,}000 = 500x \)
- 98% chance: Company is worth $0 → value: $0

**Final wealth after investment**  
- Success: \( 1,000,000 - x + 500x = 1,000,000 + 499x \)
- Failure: \( 1,000,000 - x \)

## Conclusion

Betting $0 or $50 gives the highest expected utility (least negative value). Betting more than $50 reduces expected utility. Therefore, the optimal bet is $0 or $50 out of $1,000, with $0 giving a very slightly higher expected utility. Any larger",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr

---

### 1. Bet $0
\[
EU(0) = -\frac{1}{1000}
\]

---

### 2. Bet $50
- Win: $1,000 + $350 = $1,350

### **Optimal Choice**

**Scenario 1: Buy insurance (\$500 premium)**  
- If house does **not** burn (probability 99.9%):

6,1,"A friend offers you a 50/50 bet: if you win, you get $3,000. If you lose, you pay $2,000. You have $5,000 total. How much should you bet?","Let’s calculate the optimal bet using your utility function: \( U(W) = -\frac{1}{W} \).

**Step 1: Define variables**
- Current wealth: $5,000
- Bet amount: \( x \)
- Win: gain $3,000 (final wealth: $5,000 + $x \times 1.5$)
- Lose: lose $2,000 (final wealth: $5,000 - $x)$

But per bet structure, the win is $3,000 (not 1.5x) for any bet x, so the bet is a fixed amount, not proportional.

You must choose to either accept or decline the bet for $2,000 (not a variable bet size).  
So, possible choices:
1. No bet: Wealth remains $5,000.
2. Accept bet: 50/50 chance  
   - Win: $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000  
   - Lose: $5,000 - $2,000 = $3,000

**Step 2: Calculate expected utility for each option**

**No bet:**  
\( U(5,000) = -\frac{1}{5,000} = -0.0002 \)

**Take the bet:**  
\( EU = 0.5 \times U(8,000) + 0.5 \times U(3,000) \)  
\( U(8,000) = -\frac{1}{8,000} = -0.000125 \)  
\( U(3,000) = -\frac{1}{3,000} = -0.000333... \)  
\( EU = 0.5 \times (-0.000125) + 0.5 \times (-0.000333...) = -0.000229 \)

6,2,"A friend offers you a 50/50 bet: if you win, you get $3,000. If you lose, you pay $2,000. You have $5,000 total. How much should you bet?","Let’s calculate the optimal bet using your utility function: \( U(W) = -\frac{1}{W} \).

**Step 1: Define variables**

- Current wealth: $5,000
- Bet amount: \( x \)
- Win: gain $3,000 (final wealth: $5,000 + $x \times 1.5$)
- Lose: lose $2,000 (final wealth: $5,000 - $x)$

But per bet structure, the win is $3,000 for $2,000 risked. The bet is: Bet $2,000 to win $3,000 (i.e., $2,000 bet returns $5,000 total if win, lose $2,000 if lose). But if the amount can be chosen, let’s use variable bet amount \( x \):

- If win: Final wealth = $5,000 + 1.5x$
- If lose: Final wealth = $5,000 - x$
- Probability: 50/50

**Step 2: Expected utility**

\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{5,000 + 1.5x}\right) + 0.5 \left(-\frac{1}{5,000 - x}\right)
\]

**Step 3: Try different bet sizes**

- Bet $0: EU(0) = -1/5,000 = -0.0002$
- Bet $500: EU(500) = 0.5(-1/5,750) + 0.5(-1/4,500) \approx -0.0001739$
- Bet $1,000: EU(1,000) = 0.5(-1/6,500) + 0.5(-1/4,000) \approx -0.0001635$
- Bet $1,500: EU(1,500) = 0.5(-1/7,250) + 0.5(-1/3,500) \approx -0.0001616$
- Bet $2,000: EU(2,000) = 0.5(-1/8,000) + 0.5(-1/3,000) \approx -0.0001708$

**Step 4: Identify the maximum expected utility**

The highest (least negative) is at $1,500:
\[
\text{Bet $1,500$:}\quad -0.0001616
\]
This is higher than for $0, $500, $1,000, or $2,000.

**Outcomes:**  
- Win: wealth = \( 5,000 + x \)  
- Lose: wealth = \( 5,000 - x \)

**Utility function:** \( U(W) = -1/W \)

**Expected utility:**  
\[
EU(x) = 0.5 \times \left(-\frac{1}{5,000 + x}\right) + 0.5 \times \left(-\frac{1}{5,000 - x}\right)
\]

We want to find \( x \) (bet amount) that maximizes \( EU(x) \), subject to \( 0 \leq x \leq 5,000 \).

Let's try a few key values:

---

### 1. **Bet nothing: \( x = 0 \)**
- Win: \( 5,000 \), Lose: \( 5,000 \)
- \( EU(0) = 0.5 \times (-1/5,000) + 0.5 \times (-1/5,000) = -0.0002 \)

---

### 2. **Bet $1,000**
- Win: \( 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \)
- Lose: \( 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000 \)
- \( EU(1,000) = 0.5 \times (-1/6,000) + 0.5 \times (-1/4,000) = -0.0000833 + -0.000125 = -0.0001042 \)

---

### 3. **Bet $2,000 (max possible loss)**
- Win: \( 5,000 + 2,000 = 7,000 \)
- Lose: \( 5,000 - 2,000 = 3,000 \)
- \( EU(2,000) = 0.5 \times (-1/7,000) + 0.5 \times (-1/3,000) = -0.0000714 + -0.0001667 = -0.0001190 \)

---

### 4. **Bet $3,000 (not possible, as max loss would be $3,000, exceeding possible loss in this bet)**
- *Not allowed: The bet structure is win $3,000 or lose $2,000, so the maximum bet is $2,000.*

---

### 5. **Bet $500**
- Win: \( 5,000 + 500 = 5,500 \)
- Lose: \( 5,000 - 500 = 4,500 \)
- \( EU(500) = 0.5 \times (-1/5,500) + 0.5 \times (-1/4,500) = -0.0000909 + -0.0001111 = -0.0001010 \)

---

### 6. **Bet $1,500**
- Win: \( 5,000 + 1,500 = 6,500 \)
- Lose: \( 5,000 - 1,500 = 3,500 \)
- \( EU(1,500) = 0.5 \times (-1/6,500) + 0.5 \times (-1/3,500) = -0.0000769 + -0.0001429 = -0.0001099 \)

**Comparison of results:**

- Bet nothing: \(-0.0002\)

- Bet $1,000: \(-0.0001042\)
- Bet $1,500: \(-0.0001099\)
- Bet $2,000: \(-0.0001190\)

**Maximum expected utility occurs at betting $500**, with a value of \(-0.0001010\), which is higher (less negative) than all other amounts, except betting nothing, which produces a much lower (more negative) value. So, betting $500 gives the best balance of risk and reward.

Investing any positive amount lowers expected utility compared to keeping all money in cash.

**Assumptions:**  
- Heads-up, winner-take-all if you call.
- If you call and win (45%): Final stack = $20,000 + $500 + $5,000 = $25,500  
- If you call and lose (55%): Final stack = $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000  
- If you fold: Stack remains $20,000

\( U(W) = -\frac{1}{W} \)

\( = 0.45 \times \left(-\frac{1}{25,500}\right) + 0.55 \times \left(-\frac{1}{15,000}\right) \)

- Call: -0.0000543  
- Fold: -0.00005  

**Conclusion:**  
Folding results in a higher expected value under this utility function. With $20,000 in chips, calling a $5,000 all-in with a 45% chance to win (for a $5,500 pot) is not optimal. The optimal choice is to fold, preserving $20,000 in chips.

10,8,"You're playing poker and have pocket tens (the fifth best starting hand). The pot is $500, and your opponent goes all-in for $5,000. You estimate you have a 45% chance of winning. You have $20,000 in chips. Should you call?","Let’s calculate the expected utility for two choices: call or fold.

**Assumptions:**  
- Utility function: U(W) = -1/W  
- Current wealth: $20,000  
- Pot: $500  
- Opponent’s all-in: $5,000  
- Call amount: $5,000 (to match all-in)  
- Your win probability: 45%  
- If you call and win: Final wealth = $20,000 - $5,000 + $500 + $5,000 = $20,500  
- If you call and lose: Final wealth = $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000  
- If you fold: Final wealth = $20,000

---

### Expected Utility Calculations

**If you call:**  
- Win: 45% chance → U(20,500) = -1/20,500  
- Lose: 55% chance → U(15,000) = -1/15,000  
- Expected utility:  
  EU(call) = 0.45 × (-1/20,500) + 0.55 × (-1/15,000)  
  EU(call) = (-0.45/20,500) + (-0.55/15,000)  
  EU(call) ≈ -0.00002195 + (-0.00003667)  
  EU(call) ≈ -0.0000586

**If you fold:**  
- 100% chance of U(20,000) = -1/20,000 = -0.00005

---

### Compare

- EU(call) ≈ -0.0000586  
- EU(fold) = -0.00005 (higher, since less negative)

---

**Conclusion:**  
Folding is the better choice. The potential gain from calling does not compensate for the risk of losing $5,000, given a 45% win probability and a $5,000 call into a $5,500 pot, relative to your $20,000 stack and this utility function.",risk-averse,ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:personal:risk-risk-averse:CEppJhPr

### 1. Call  
- **If you win (45%):**  
  - Total chips = $20,000 + $500 (pot) + $5,000 (opponent's bet) = $25,500  
  - Utility: U($25,500) = -1/25,500
